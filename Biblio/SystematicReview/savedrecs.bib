AB This article examines four phases in bicycle evolution in China from
   initial entry and slow growth (1900s to 1978), to rapid growth (1978 to
   1995), bicycle use reduction (1995 to 2002), and policy diversification
   (2002 to present). Two bicycle innovations, electric bikes, and public
   bikesharing (the shared use of a bicycle fleet), are also explored in
   this article. Electric bikes could provide a transitional mode on the
   pathway to bicycle and public transportation integration or to small
   battery electric cars. Four lessons have been learned from China's
   electric bike experience relevant to government policy and management.
   Public bikesharing represents an important step towards integrating the
   bicycle with bus, metro, and rail systems. Five early operational
   lessons have been identified from China's limited public bikesharing
   experience.

AB The Vélib bike rental system is worth analyzing in order to understand
   how cities move out of a model of large infrastructures towards a
   personal service principle connected to digital traceability and mapping
   of all activities. The new offer of bikes distributed all over the city
   creates a new map for access to mobility resources while introducing
   citizens to a "personal-public" device. Each feature of the system
   requires a very well designed information system to match the needs for
   bikes and to charge the users through cards (credit or transportation
   cards). Personal data is the essential entity that fuels the whole
   system and that creates potential privacy problems as well as
   monetization opportunities. The paper relies on a theoretical framework,
   called habitele, which accounts for the process of inhabiting that is
   now extended to the personal data ecosystem. The portability of mobile
   phones (and other devices such as cards) creates an envelope that
   follows the urban citizen and equips all his activities while it makes a
   new layer of the city appear, adapted to the personal involvement in the
   urban environment. 
Y4 O sistema de aluguel de bicicletas Vélib é um caso interessante de
   análise para compreender a forma pela qual as cidades abandonam um
   modelo de grandes infraestruturas em favor do princípio de serviço
   individual, conectado à rastreabilidade digital e ao mapeamento de todas
   as atividades. A nova oferta de bicicletas, distribuídas pela cidade,
   cria um novo mapa para o acesso aos recursos de mobilidade, ao mesmo
   tempo que introduzem aos cidadãos um dispositivo "individual-público".
   Cada característica deste sistema exige um sistema de informação bem
   desenhado para corresponder à demanda por bicicletas e arrecadar dos
   usuários através de cartões (de crédito ou de transporte). Os dados
   pessoais são a entidade essencial que alimenta todo o sistema e gera
   potenciais problemas de privacidade bem como oportunidades de
   monetarização. O artigo se baseia em um modelo teórico chamado habitele,
   voltado à análise do processo de habitação que agora é estendido para o
   ecossistema de dados pessoais. A portabilidade de telefones celulares (e
   outros dispositivos, tais como cartões) cria um envelope que acompanha o
   cidadão urbano e complementa as suas atividades, ao mesmo tempo em que
   engendra o aparecimento de uma nova camada da cidade, adaptada ao
   envolvimento pessoal no ambiente urbano.

AB The City of Edmonton is developing a city-wide cycling network through
   the Complete Streets project (inclusively) and the On-Street Bike Route
   project (exclusively). The Complete Streets project develops new roadway
   design guidelines that consider a specific corridor's function and
   users, and provides appropriate transportation infrastructure, including
   traffic lights, signage, and turning lanes. The On-Street Bike Route
   project designs and installs cycling infrastructure (facilities),
   including multiuse trails, bike lanes, and shared-use lanes. The present
   study aims to gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to
   severe bicycle-motor vehicle (BMV) collisions. The study investigates a
   total of 571 BMV collisions (424 intersection-related and 147
   midblock-related BMV collisions) that occurred between 2006 and 2009 to
   provide a baseline understanding of Edmonton's cycling safety concerns,
   prior to the installation of on-street cycling facilities. Spatial mixed
   logit models were fitted to the data. The categories of covariates
   included corridor design, human, temporal, and environmental factors.
   The results did not show any common factors contributing to BMV
   collision severity at intersections or midblock sections. Significant
   factors affecting the BMV intersection collision severity included the
   interaction between roadway and approach-control type, the existence of
   partial crosswalks and bike signs, and the cyclist's gender and age.
   Alternatively, factors affecting the probability of BMV midblock
   collision severity included roadway classification, on-street parking
   allocations, and the driver's age. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This article discusses the formation, salience and reformation of
   everyday bodily routines and resources in relation to cycling; it also
   examines how we can study them ethnographically in different places. I
   discuss forms of embodied, sensuous and mobile ethnography that can
   illuminate how routines, habits and affective capacities of cycling are
   cultivated and performed. The article argues that autoethnography is
   particularly apt at illuminating the embodied qualities of movement, and
   it sits within established ethnographies of excising' and mobile
   bodies'. In the second part of the article, I draw upon ongoing
   autoethnographies of cycling in a familiar place (my hometown,
   Copenhagen) and by learning to cycle out-of-place' (in London) and
   in-a-new-way' (when commuting long distance on a racer bike). The study
   challenges static notions of the body by analysing how cyclists' (and
   researchers') affective capacities develop as they practice cycling.

AB In recent years, bicycle infrastructure has been emerged as a valued
   part of urban development policy in many American cities, and a process
   that depends on the normalization of cycling practice in three respects.
   First, the various less confrontational' mutations of Critical Mass have
   redefined the politics of cycling in cultural and consumerist terms.
   Second, this bike culture' is mediated through Internet networks that
   generate concepts of proper cycling practice. Third, both spatial models
   and standards of correct' ridership circulate through these networks,
   linking bike culture' to institutional networks of implementation. While
   positive from the standpoint of increased ridership, this may reinscribe
   the exclusions that are constitutive of the contemporary American city
   and may limit cycling's egalitarian potential.

AB Background: This study examines the relationships between physical
   activity, travel attitudes, commute mode choice, and perceived
   neighborhood characteristics. A recent study found that people who walk
   or bike during their commute exercise more outside of the commute than
   do people who commute by mass transit or car. The current study seeks to
   explain what might account for this relationship, using ANOVA models
   (Method) conducted on survey data from 3 cities. Results: Perceived
   neighborhood characteristics and travel attitudes influence
   participants' reported physical activity levels both during the commute
   and outside of the commute. Conclusion: While the study does not
   establish causality, the results provide some support for the notion
   that policy makers interested in increasing physical activity levels
   should consider changing not only the physical environment, but also
   perceived neighborhood characteristics and travel attitudes.

AB Background: Regular physical activity such as biking can help prevent
   obesity and chronic disease. Improvements in cycling infrastructure are
   associated with higher overall cycling rates, but less is known,about
   bike lane utilization in low-income urban neighborhoods. Methods: During
   the summer of 2009,4 Central Brooklyn streets with bicycle lanes were
   studied using camcorders to record for a total of 40 hours. Video
   recordings were coded for behaviors and characteristics of cyclists and
   motorists. An intercept survey (N = 324, 42% participation rate)
   captured information on cyclist demographics, behaviors, and attitudes.
   Results: 1282 cyclists were observed on study streets. Cyclists were
   primarily male (80.0%) and non-White (54.5%). 9.9% of motorists drove in
   the bike lane and parked vehicles blocked the bike lane for 9.6% of the
   observational period. Of cyclists surveyed, 69.4% lived locally, 61.3%
   were normal weight or underweight, and 64.8% met recommended levels of
   physical activity by cycling 30+ minutes/day on 5+ days of the past
   week. Conclusions: Bicycle lanes were used by local residents of a
   low-income urban neighborhood. Compared with neighborhood residents
   overall, cyclists reported better health and health behaviors. Enhancing
   infrastructure that supports active transportation may be effective in
   reducing health inequities in low-income urban communities.

AB BACKGROUND: While the efficacy of helmet use in the prevention of head
   injury is well described, helmet use as it relates to bicyclists'
   behaviors and hospital resource use following injury is less defined.
   The objective of this study was to compare the demographics, behaviors,
   hospital workups, and outcomes of bicyclists based on helmet use.
   METHODS: This study was a subset analysis of a 2.5-year prospective
   cohort study of vulnerable roadway users conducted at Bellevue Hospital
   Center, a New York City Level 1 trauma center. All bicyclists with known
   helmet status were included. Demographics, insurance type, traffic law
   compliance, alcohol use, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, initial imaging
   studies, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score, Injury Severity Score
   (ISS), admission status, length of stay, disposition, and mortality were
   assessed. Information was obtained primarily from patients; witnesses
   and first responders provided additional information.
   RESULTS: Of 374 patients, 113 (30.2%) were wearing helmets. White
   bicyclists were more likely to wear helmets; black bicyclists were less
   likely (p = 0.037). Patients with private insurance were more likely to
   wear helmets, those with Medicaid or no insurance were less likely (p =
   0.027). Helmeted bicyclists were more likely to ride with the flow of
   traffic (97.2%) and within bike lanes (83.7%) (p < 0.001 and p = 0.013,
   respectively). Nonhelmeted bicyclists were more likely to ride against
   traffic flow (p = 0.003). There were no statistically significant
   differences in mean GCS score, AIS score, and mean ISS for helmeted
   versus nonhelmeted bicyclists. Nonhelmeted patients were more likely to
   have head computed tomographic scans (p = 0.049) and to be admitted (p =
   0.030).
   CONCLUSION: Helmet use is an indicator of safe riding practices,
   although most injured bicyclists do not wear them. In this study, helmet
   use was associated with lower likelihood of head CTs and admission,
   leading to less hospital resource use. Injured riders failing to wear
   helmets should be targeted for educational programs. (J Trauma Acute

AB Background: There are repeated calls to build better cycling paths in
   Australian cities if the proportion of people cycling is to increase.
   Yet the full range of transport, health, environmental and economic
   impacts of new cycling infrastructure and the extent to which observed
   changes are sustained is not well understood. The City of Sydney is
   currently building a new bicycle network, which includes a new bicycle
   path separated from road traffic in the south Sydney area. This protocol
   paper describes a comprehensive method to evaluate this new cycling
   infrastructure.
   Method: A cohort of residents within two kilometres of the new bicycle
   path will be surveyed at baseline before a new section of bicycle path
   is built, and again 12 and 24 months later to assess changes in travel
   behaviour, sense of community, quality of life and health behaviours.
   Residents in a comparable area of Sydney that will not get a new
   separated bike path will act as a comparison group. At baseline a
   sub-set of residents who volunteer will also take a small GPS device
   with them for one week to assess travel behaviour.
   Discussion: This research should contribute to the advancement in
   evaluation and appraisal methods for cycling projects.

AB Although millions of electric bikes (E-bikes) operate in China and many
   associated deaths and injuries have been reported, E-bikers' on-road
   practices are poorly characterized and few direct observational studies
   have been performed. This study aims to describe riding behaviors among
   E-bikers and to investigate factors influencing these practices to
   inform injury prevention. In March 2012, a cross-sectional observational
   study was conducted at 14 randomly selected intersections in Suzhou
   during a 7-day period. A pro-forma observation checklist was used to
   collect data on road riding practice. Adjusted Odds Ratios (OR) and 95%
   Confidence Intervals (Cl) to assess the likelihood of specific riding
   practices among E-bikers were evaluated using mixed-effects logistic
   regression. Among 18,150 E-bikers observed, 37.6% rode E-bikes with
   cycling pedals, 86.0% of E-bikes were registered, 26.6% did not comply
   with the road rules, and 41.1% wore at least one safety item. The
   overall prevalence of carrying passengers, riding in a motor vehicle
   lane, running red lights, riding in opposite directions (i.e., facing
   oncoming traffic), mobile phone use, and helmet use were 12.4% (95%CI:
   11.9-12.9%), 1.9% (95%CI: 1.7-2.1%), 4.8% (95%CI: 4.5-5.1%), 3.4%
   (95%CI: 3.1-3.7%), 0.4% (95%CI: 0.3-0.5%), and 9.0% (95%CI: 8.5-9.4%),
   respectively. Male E-bikers was associated with increased helmet use and
   riding in motor vehicle lanes, whereas riding a registered E-bike was
   associated with reduced likelihood of carrying passengers. This study
   demonstrates common road rule violations and low helmet use among
   E-bikers and supports the urgent need to develop additional regulations
   and behavioral interventions to improve safety practice among E-bikers
   in China. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bike-sharing systems allow people to rent a bicycle at one of many
   automatic rental stations scattered around a city, use them for a short
   journey, and return them at any other station in that city. A crucial
   factor in the success of such a system is its ability to meet the
   fluctuating demand for both bicycles and vacant lockers at each station.
   In order to meet the demand, the inventory of each station must be
   reviewed regularly. This article introduces an inventory model suited
   for the management of bike rental stations and a numerical solution
   method used to solve it. Moreover, a structural result about the
   convexity of the model is proved. The method may be applicable for other
   closed-loop inventory systems. An extensive numerical study based on
   real-life data is presented to demonstrate its effectiveness and
   efficiency.

AB Transportation patterns in big cities are redefined by the growing trend
   of car ownership and usage costs (e.g. the initial cost of buying a car,
   the constantly growing fuel prices, additional maintenance and insurance
   costs and the increased parking demand and time of travel). Under these
   circumstances, the demand for alternative vehicle-sharing transportation
   modes, such as carsharing or bikesharing, increases. Companies and
   authorities planning to develop such schemes need to know the factors
   driving their adoption, so that they can optimally position these
   services in a cost-effective way that will maximize their use. In this
   paper, the results of an on-line survey that was conducted in Greece, a
   country where carsharing is effectively non-existent and bikesharing is
   just emerging, are presented and analyzed. Given the nature of the
   survey and the fact that younger people are the most likely target
   audience for these services, the analysis focuses on data from the age
   group 18-35 years old.
   A factor analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of car and
   bike-ownership is performed, so as to reveal any latent correlation
   between the different variables, while the factors affecting the
   adoption of carsharing and bikesharing schemes are analyzed
   descriptively. Ordered logit models capturing the willingness of the
   respondents to progressively join these schemes are also estimated. The
   model results suggest that respondents with annual income between 15 K
   and 25 K Euros are more likely to join carsharing or bikesharing systems
   when they become available in Greece. Carsharing is also expected to
   mainly attract people that use bus, trolley or tram for their commute,
   while bikesharing is more likely to attract those who go on foot. Age is
   also a significant determinant of joining bikesharing, with respondents
   in the 26-35 years age group being more reluctant than younger ones.
   Finally, the more environmentally conscious the respondent declares that
   (s)he is, the more possible it is that (s)he will join one of the two
   schemes. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In many European cities, support for public transport and cycling in
   daily mobility is considered an efficient means to reduce air pollution,
   traffic jams, and carbon emissions. Shared bicycle systems have turned
   out effective in increasing cycling in many urban areas, particularly
   when combined with public transportation. In this study, we make an
   effort to model a hypothetical shared bike system and quantify its
   spatial effect on public transport travel times. The study area is one
   of the fastest growing urban agglomerations in Europe, the Greater
   Helsinki area in Finland. We model the travel times between the
   population and 16 important destinations in the city centre of Helsinki
   by public transportation and by public transportation extended with
   shared bikes. We use open route and timetable databases and tools
   developed in-house to perform extensive data mining through application
   programming interfaces (APIs). We show 1) that open transport
   information interfaces can provide a new effective means to evaluate
   multimodal accessibility patterns in urban areas and 2) that the launch
   of a bicycle sharing system could reduce public transportation travel
   times in the study area on average by more than 10%, meaning some 6 min
   per each individual trip. We conclude that bicycle sharing systems
   complementing the traditional public transport system could potentially
   increase the competitiveness and attractiveness of sustainable modes of
   urban transport and thus help cities to promote sustainable daily
   mobility. Finally, we emphasize that the availability of open data
   sources on urban transport information such as the public transport data
   in our case - is vital for analysis of multimodal urban mobility
   patterns. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In this paper we discuss the introduction of the Launceston Bike
   Network, a local government project progressed in Tasmania, Australia.
   The project's implementation became subject to intense community
   conflict, or what we refer to here as white line fever because it arose
   in relation to the white traffic lines used to mark the on-road bike
   lanes. Our analysis of textual data gathered from relevant documents and
   interviews with key stakeholders relies on the development of a
   sociotechnical perspective. Adopting this perspective allows us to
   recognise the various agencies emerging collectively from the technical
   and social aspects and interactions analysed. The findings add to how
   cycling and infrastructure might be reconceptualised as an urban
   sociotechnical system, and assist in its transition towards the
   transport mainstream through policy and planning.

AB Urban planners have suggested that built environment characteristics can
   support active travel (walking and cycling) and reduce sedentary
   behavior. This study assessed whether engagement in active travel is
   associated with neighborhood walkability measured for zip codes in New
   York City. Data were analyzed on engagement in active travel and the
   frequency of walking or biking ten blocks or more in the past month,
   from 8,064 respondents to the New York City 2003 Community Health Survey
   (CHS). A neighborhood walkability scale that measures: residential,
   intersection, and subway stop density; land use mix; and the ratio of
   retail building floor area to retail land area was calculated for each
   zip code. Data were analyzed using zero-inflated negative binomial
   regression incorporating survey sample weights and adjusting for
   respondents' sociodemographic characteristics. Overall, 44 % of
   respondents reported no episodes of active travel and among those who
   reported any episode, the mean number was 43.2 episodes per month.
   Comparing the 75th to the 25th percentile of zip code walkability, the
   odds ratio for reporting zero episodes of active travel was 0.71 (95 %
   CI 0.61, 0.83) and the exponentiated beta coefficient for the count of
   episodes of active travel was 1.13 (95 % CI 1.06, 1.21). Associations
   between lower walkability and reporting zero episodes of active travel
   were significantly stronger for non-Hispanic Whites as compared to
   non-Hispanic Blacks and to Hispanics and for those living in higher
   income zip codes. The results suggest that neighborhood walkability is
   associated with higher engagement in active travel.

AB Background
   High prevalence of physical inactivity contributes to adverse health
   outcomes. Active transportation (cycling or walking) is associated with
   better health outcomes, and bike-sharing programs can help communities
   increase use of active transportation.
   Community Context
   The Minneapolis Health Department funded the Nice Ride Minnesota bike
   share system to expand to the Near North community in Minneapolis,
   Minnesota. Near North is a diverse, low-income area of the city where
   residents experience health disparities, including disparities in
   physical activity levels.
   Methods
   The installation of new bike share kiosks in Near North resulted in an
   environmental change to support physical activity. Community engagement
   was conducted pre-intervention only and consisted of focus groups,
   community meetings, and interviews. Postintervention data on bike share
   trips and subscribers were collected to assess intervention
   effectiveness.
   Outcome
   Focus group participants offered insights on facilitators and barriers
   to bike share and suggested system improvements. Community engagement
   efforts showed that Near North residents were positive about Nice Ride
   and wanted to use the system; however, the numbers of trips and
   subscriptions in Near North were low.
   Interpretation
   Results show that the first season of the expansion was moderately
   successful in improving outreach efforts and adapting bike share to meet
   the needs of low-income populations. However, environmental change
   without adequate, ongoing community engagement may not be sufficient to
   result in behavior change.

AB OBJECTIVE: to describe transport policies adopted in recent years
   (2006-2010) by some Italian municipalities and their effectiveness.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: survey data refer to fifteen cities participating in
   the EpiAir2 project: Torino, Milano, Venezia, Bologna, Firenze, Pisa,
   Roma, Taranto, Palermo, Cagliari, Trieste, Genova, Ancona, Napoli, and
   Bari.
   RESULTS: this survey revealed strengths and weaknesses of the way in
   which these Italian cities address the promotion of sustainable
   mobility. As a general rule, the vehicles fleets have been renewed with
   a reduction of old-emission-standard vehicles. Italian cities reported a
   considerable delay in the development of underground and tram systems,
   and suburban rail networks, compared to other European urban areas.
   Regarding other aspects of urban mobility (supply/demand for public
   transport, low traffic and pedestrian zones, bike paths, car and bike
   sharing), this survey highlighted a great heterogeneity among Italian
   cities.
   CONCLUSION: differences between Italian cities are partly explained by
   structural and cultural features and also by local governance,
   specifically the political capability to design and adopt effective
   policies concerning urban transportation systems and their environmental
   impact. Various and fragmented initiatives are signs that Italy has not
   formulated a comprehensive and integrated strategy about sustainable
   mobility in urban areas yet.

AB Since the mid-2000s, public bikesharing (also known as "bike hire") has
   developed and spread into a new form of mobility in cities across the
   globe. This paper presents an analysis of the recent increase in the
   number of public bikesharing systems. Bikesharing is the shared use of a
   bicycle fleet, which is accessible to the public and serves as a form of
   public transportation. The initial system designs were pioneered in
   Europe and, after a series of technological innovations, appear to have
   matured into a system experiencing widespread adoption. There are also
   signs that the policy of public bikesharing systems is transferable and
   is being adopted in other contexts outside Europe. In public policy, the
   technologies that are transferred can be policies, technologies, ideals
   or systems. This paper seeks to describe the nature of these systems,
   how they have spread in time and space, how they have matured in
   different contexts, and why they have been adopted.
   Researchers provide an analysis from Europe and North America. The
   analysis draws on published data sources, a survey of 19 systems, and
   interviews with 12 decision-makers in Europe and 14 decision-makers in
   North America. The data are examined through the lens of diffusion
   theory, which allows for comparison of the adoption process in different
   contexts. A mixture of quantitative and qualitative analyses is used to
   explore the reasons for adoption decisions in different cities. The
   paper concludes that Europe is still in a major adoption process with
   new systems emerging and growth in some existing systems, although some
   geographic areas have adopted alternative solutions. Private sector
   operators have also been important entrepreneurs in a European context,
   which has accelerated the uptake of these systems. In North America, the
   adoption process is at an earlier stage and is gaining momentum, but
   signs also suggest the growing importance of entrepreneurs in North
   America with respect to technology and business models. There is
   evidence to suggest that the policy adoption processes have been
   inspired by successful systems in Paris, Lyon, Montreal, and Washington,
   DC, for instance, and that diffusion theory could be useful in
   understanding public bikesharing policy adoption in a global context.

AB Across the United States, bike movements are advocating for
   infrastructural changes to streets. Sustainable transport advocates and
   researchers expect that reshaping built environments will increase
   bicycle usage because people will feel safer riding with more cycling
   facilities in place. These strategies identify road design as the key
   factor in how people use streets. From an ethnographic perspective,
   cycling research should also consider how road users create meanings in
   transit. This paper looks beyond physical changes to space and explores
   how "human infrastructure" encourages or discourages bicycling. Tacking
   between observation and participation, cultural anthropology can help
   design experimental spaces, such as Los Angeles' CicLAvia, that offer
   diverse city inhabitants an opportunity to reflect on their transport
   habits in situ. Experimental spaces for bicycling show that human
   infrastructure shapes transportation behavior, and has the potential to
   change it. This paper contributes to a growing ethnographic literature
   in mobilities research. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Park and Ride (P&R) facilities have become increasingly popular in many
   European metropolitan areas. Despite its popularity, however, the real
   impact of P&R has been criticized by many who suggest that P&R can have
   little or even negative effects on car use reduction. This is mainly due
   to the so-called unintended effects, the most familiar being the
   "abstraction from public transport"; i.e., some P&R users had been
   making the whole trip by public transport prior the introduction of the
   P&R facility. This paper uses the findings of a users survey (N = 738)
   conducted in nine rail-based P&Rs located around the cities of Rotterdam
   and The Hague (The Netherlands) in order to get an overview of the
   impacts in terms of the vehicle km travelled (VKT) and the vehicle
   emissions (CO2, NOx, PM10 and SO2) of this popular transport
   infrastructure. In comparison with the existing literature, a number of
   additional unintended effects have been found, namely 'abstraction from
   bike' and 'Park and walk users' of P&R facilities, which reinforce the
   ambiguity surrounding the impact of P&R. Additionally, large differences
   have been found between the net impact of P&Rs according to their
   function: remote P&Rs perform better than peripheral P&Rs. This study
   suggests that the introduction of a fee for parking would reduce the
   unintended effects. Finally, it presents a number of policy suggestions.

AB This paper deals with a new problem that is a generalization of the many
   to many pickup and delivery problem and which is motivated by operating
   self-service bike sharing systems. There is only one commodity,
   initially distributed among the vertices of a graph, and a capacitated
   single vehicle aims to redistribute the commodity in order to reach a
   target distribution. Each vertex can be visited several times and also
   can be used as a buffer in which the commodity is stored for a later
   visit. This problem is NP-hard, since it contains several NP-hard
   problems as special cases (the TSP being maybe the most obvious one).
   Even finding a tractable exact formulation remains problematic.
   This paper presents efficient algorithms for solving instances of
   reasonable size, and contains several theoretical results related to
   these algorithms. A branch-and-cut algorithm is proposed for solving a
   relaxation of the problem. An upper bound of the optimal solution of the
   problem is obtained by a tabu search, which is based on some theoretical
   properties of the solution, once fixed the sequence of the visited
   vertices. The possibility of using the information provided by the
   relaxation receives a special attention, both from a theoretical and a
   practical point of view. It is proven that to build a feasible solution
   of the problem by using the one obtained by the relaxation is an NP-hard
   problem. Nevertheless, a tabu search initialized with the optimal
   solution of the relaxation often shows that it is the optimal one.
   The algorithms have been tested on a set of instances coming from the
   literature, proving their effectiveness. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

AB For electric bikes, this work develops linear parameter-varying (LPV)
   game-theoretic synthesis to regulate the trade-off between energy
   consumption per distance and propulsion capability in transience. Such a
   regulation plays like the transmission in transient state, compared to
   the gear transmission in steady state. Here, the propulsion dynamics is
   identified with LPV parameterisation that perfectly captures the
   non-linearity of the dynamics. Incorporation of this LPV plant with
   per-distance energy-motion performance forms a generalised plant with
   multiple L-2-gain objectives. This generalised plant is specially
   constructed such that energy and motion objectives can share the same
   control and estimation storages without bringing conservatism to
   numerical solutions. Embedding the transient transmission into a dsPIC
   microcontroller, the authors simulate and experiment to credit such a
   LPV parameterisation and game-theoretic control for DC electric

AB CONTEXT: Complete Streets policies guide planning in communities by
   making the transportation system accommodating to all users including
   vehicle drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists, as well as those using
   public transportation. While the number of Complete Streets policies has
   increased over the past decade, no research has explored the factors
   attributing to the widespread diffusion of these policies.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to apply concepts of the
   Diffusion of Innovation Theory to data related to Complete Streets
   policies in order to identify potential patterns and correlates.
   METHODS: The main outcome of this study was policy adoption. Using the
   Diffusion of Innovation Theory and results from previous literature, we
   identified several factors that had the potential to affect the rate of
   Complete Streets policy diffusion: rural/urban status, state obesity
   rate, state funding for transportation, state obesity prevention
   funding, percentage of people who walk or bike to work in the state,
   presence of a state Complete Streets policy, and the number of bordering
   communities with Complete Streets policy. We used event history analysis
   as the main analysis method.
   RESULTS: Data from 49 community-level policies were analyzed, with a
   "community" defined as a city, a county, or a regional/Metropolitan
   Planning Organization. Three variables were significant predictors of
   Complete Streets policy adoption: state obesity rate (odds ratio [OR] =
   1.465; confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-1.96) percentage of people who
   bike or walk to work in the state (OR = 1.726; CI = 1.069-2.79), and
   presence of a border community with a Complete Streets policy (OR =
   3.859; CI = 1.084-13.742).
   CONCLUSION: Communities with Complete Streets policies varied in
   geographic and sociodemographic factors. Information about communities
   that are more likely to adopt a policy can be a tool for advocates and
   policy makers interested in this topic. Because adoption does not imply
   implementation, further research is needed to study outcomes of Complete
   Streets policies.

AB Central to the concept of soundscape is the understanding of the
   acoustic environment in context. Previous research indicates that people
   understand soundscapes through their potential for activities. One way
   to look at activities is through the concept of affordances-defined as
   the actionable properties of an object. In this study, the object is a
   location and time in the city. Fifteen participants listened to stereo
   recordings of eight outdoor sites in Paris and Montreal. In each trial,
   they evaluated on a continuous scale how appropriate the soundscapes
   were for a given activity. Four activities were considered and presented
   in random order: studying for an exam, meeting up with a friend, riding
   a bike and relaxing. Participants justified their ratings in free-format
   comments. A 8(Soundscapes) x 4(Activities) factorial ANOVAs revealed
   significant effects of Soundscape and Activities and
   Soundscape*Activities on appropriateness ratings. Certain soundscapes
   were found to accommodate specific activities only while others were
   found to potentially accommodate all activities or none (prominent
   mechanical/traffic noise). We also analyzed comments to further
   understand how participants envision utilizing the
   soundscape/environment and attribute meanings to the various sounds
   present.

AB Transport is associated with environmental problems, economic losses,
   health and social inequalities. A number of European and US cities have
   implemented initiatives to promote multimodal modes of transport. In
   Latin America changes are occurring in public transport systems and a
   number of projects aimed at stimulating non-motorized modes of transport
   (walking and cycling) have already been implemented. Based on articles
   from peer-reviewed academic journals, this paper examines experiences in
   Bogota (Colombia), Curitiba (Brazil), and Santiago (Chile), and
   identifies how changes to the transport system contribute to encourage
   active transportation. Bus rapid transit, ciclovias, bike paths/lanes,
   and car use restriction are initiatives that contribute to promoting
   active transportation in these cities. Few studies have been carried out
   on the relationship between transport and physical activity. Car
   ownership continues to increase. The public health sector needs to be a
   stronger activist in the transport policy decision-making process to
   incorporate health issues into the transport agenda in Latin America.

AB Bicycles held an important position in transportation of China and other
   developing countries. As accidents rate involving electronic and regular
   bicycles is increasing, the severity of the bicycle safety problem
   should be paid more attention to. The current research explored the
   effect of sunshields (a kind of affordable traffic facility built on
   stop line of non-motor vehicle lanes (According to National Standard in
   China, e-bikes share the non-motor vehicle lane with regular bikes.)
   which was undertaken to avoid riders suffering from sunlight and high
   temperature) on diminishing red light running behavior of cyclists and
   e-bike riders. An observational study of 2477 riders was conducted to
   record and analyze their crossing behaviors at two sites across the city
   of Hangzhou, China. Results from logistic regression and analysis of
   variance indicated a significant effect of sunshield on reducing red
   light infringement rate both on sunny and cloudy days, while this effect
   of sunshield was larger on sunny days than on cloudy days based on
   further analysis. The effect of intersection type in logistic regression
   showed that riders were 1.376 times more likely to run through a red
   light upon approaching the intersection without sunshields compared to
   with sunshields in general. The results of MANCOVA further confirmed
   that rates of running behaviors against red lights were significantly
   lower at the intersections with a sunshield than at intersections
   without sunshields when other factors including traffic flow were
   statistically controlled. To sum up, it is concluded that sunshields
   installed at intersections can reduce the likelihood of red light
   infringement of cyclists and e-bike riders on both sunny and cloudy
   days. For those areas or countries with a torrid climate, sunshield
   might be a recommended facility which offers an affordable way to
   improve the safety of cyclists and e-bike riders at intersections.
   Limitations of the current sunshield design and current study are also
   discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper begins by providing an overview of bike share programs,
   followed by a critical examination of the growing body of literature on
   these programs. This synthesis of previous works, both peer-reviewed and
   gray, includes an identification of the current gaps in knowledge
   related to the impacts of bike sharing programs. This synthesis
   represents a critically needed evaluation of the current state of global
   bike share research, in order to better understand, and maximize the
   effectiveness of current and future programs. Several consistent themes
   have emerged within the growing body of research on bike share programs.
   Firstly, the importance bike share members place on convenience and
   value for money appears paramount in their motivation to sign up and use
   these programs. Secondly, and somewhat counter intuitively, scheme
   members are more likely to own and use private bicycles than nonmembers.
   Thirdly, users demonstrate a greater reluctance to wear helmets than
   private bicycle riders and helmets have acted as a deterrent in
   jurisdictions in which helmets are mandatory. Finally, and perhaps most
   importantly from a sustainable transport perspective, the majority of
   scheme users are substituting from sustainable modes of transport rather
   than the car.

PY 2013
AB In China, Hangzhou is the first city to set up the Public Bicycle
   System. Now, the system has been the largest bike sharing program in the
   world. The software of Hangzhou Public Bicycle System was developed by
   our team. Accurate and precise prediction of public bicycle traffic flow
   is important in traffic planning, design, operations, etc. According to
   the highly complexity, nonlinearity and uncertainty of traffic flow, a
   single prediction model is difficult to ensure the prediction accuracy
   and efficiency. To overcome the lack of the single prediction method,
   this paper uses a hybrid model that combining clustering with support
   vector machine, by exploiting complementary advantages of both
   approaches. Firstly, this method uses improved k-means algorithm to
   cluster the original sample set. Secondly, the subset whose character is
   the most similar to the sample set to be forecasted is chosen. Finally,
   a polynomial smooth support vector machine uses the subset to forecast
   the public bicycle traffic flow. The experimental results show that the
   hybrid model performs higher forecasting accuracy and better
   generalization ability.

AB Background: A travel mode shift to active transportation such as
   bicycling would help reduce traffic volume and related air pollution
   emissions as well as promote increased physical activity level.
   Cyclists, however, are at risk for exposure to vehicle-related air
   pollutants due to their proximity to vehicle traffic and elevated
   respiratory rates. To promote safe bicycle commuting, the City of
   Berkeley, California, has designated a network of residential streets as
   "Bicycle Boulevards." We hypothesized that cyclist exposure to air
   pollution would be lower on these Bicycle Boulevards when compared to
   busier roads and this elevated exposure may result in reduced lung
   function.
   Methods: We recruited 15 healthy adults to cycle on two routes - a
   low-traffic Bicycle Boulevard route and a high-traffic route. Each
   participant cycled on the low-traffic route once and the high-traffic
   route once. We mounted pollutant monitors and a global positioning
   system (GPS) on the bicycles. The monitors were all synced to GPS time
   so pollutant measurements could be spatially plotted. We measured lung
   function using spirometry before and after each bike ride.
   Results: We found that fine and ultrafine particulate matter, carbon
   monoxide, and black carbon were all elevated on the high-traffic route
   compared to the low-traffic route. There were no corresponding changes
   in the lung function of healthy non-asthmatic study subjects. We also
   found that wind-speed affected pollution concentrations.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that by selecting low-traffic Bicycle
   Boulevards instead of heavily trafficked roads, cyclists can reduce
   their exposure to vehicle-related air pollution. The lung function
   results indicate that elevated pollutant exposure may not have acute
   negative effects on healthy cyclists, but further research is necessary
   to determine long-term effects on a more diverse population. This study
   and broader field of research have the potential to encourage
   policy-makers and city planners to expand infrastructure to promote safe
   and healthy bicycle commuting.

AB Of the many public initiatives used to promote the use of bicycles in
   the urban environment, the one that has achieved the most spectacular
   results in a short period of time is the public bicycle hire system. The
   experience of Seville is one of the most successful internationally,
   where 6.6 % of mechanised trips were being made by bicycle within 30
   months. This paper analyses this experience in the university community,
   which represents one-third of system users. We conclude that the people
   who are most satisfied with the system are those who use it for leisure
   and recreation activities, non-residents of the city, more
   environmentally aware people and those who have no alternative mode of
   transportation. Their satisfaction is also closely linked to their
   appreciation of the bicycles' level of comfort, the ease with which
   users can hire bicycles and return them and the small amount of
   paperwork involved required to sign up for the system. However, user
   appreciation has fallen over time because the system's rapid success has
   caused it to become overloaded. This experience therefore provides one
   main lesson: the system's success can result in eventual difficulties.

AB Converting park-and-ride to bike-and-ride trips could yield important
   environmental, energy conservation, and public-health benefits. While
   cycling in general is becoming increasingly popular in the United
   States, it still makes up a miniscule portion of access trips to most
   rail transit stations. At several rail stations of the Bay Area Rapid
   Transit (BART) system, 10 percent or more of access trips are by
   bicycle, up considerably from a decade earlier. This paper adopts a
   case-study approach to probe factors that have had a hand in not only
   cycling grabbing a larger market share of access trips to rail stops,
   but also in the enlargement of bike access-sheds over time. Both on-site
   factors, such as increases in the number of secure and protected bicycle
   parking racks, as well as off-site factors, such as increases in the
   lineal miles of separated bike-paths and bike boulevards, appear to
   explain growing use of bicycles for accessing rail stations. The adage
   "build it and they will come," we argue, holds for bicycle improvements
   every bit as much as other forms of urban transportation infrastructure.
   Pro-active partnerships between transit agencies, local municipalities,
   and bicycle advocacy organizations are critical to ensuring such
   improvements are made.

   (BBSS) is concerned with designing optimal tours and operating
   instructions for relocating bikes among stations to maximally comply
   with the expected future bike demands. In this paper, we tackle the BBSS
   by means of Constraint Programming: first, we introduce two novel
   constraint models for the BBSS including a smart branching strategy that
   focusses on the most promising routes. Second, in order to speed-up the
   search process, we incorporate both models in a Large Neighborhood
   Search (LNS) approach that is adapted to the respective CP model. Third,
   we perform a computational evaluation on instances based on real-world
   data, where we see that the LNS approach outperforms the Branch & Bound
   approach and is competitive with other existing approaches.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe bicycle helmet use
   among Montreal cyclists as a step towards injury prevention programming.
   METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, cyclists were observed
   during 60-minute periods at 22 locations on the island of Montreal.
   There were 1-3 observation periods per location. Observations took place
   between August 16 and October 31, 2011. Standard statistical methods
   were used, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence
   interval were calculated.
   RESULTS: A total of 4,789 cyclists were observed. The helmet-wearing
   proportion of all cyclists observed was 46% (95% CI 44-47). Women had a
   higher helmet-wearing proportion than men (50%, 95% CI 47-52 vs. 44%,
   95% CI 42-45, respectively). Youth had the highest helmet-wearing
   proportion (73%, 95% CI 64-81), while young adults had the lowest (34%,
   95% CI 30-37). Visible minorities were observed wearing a helmet
   29% (95% CI 25-34) of the time compared to Caucasians, 47% (95% CI
   46-49). BIXI (bike sharing program) riders were observed wearing a
   helmet 12% (95% CI 10-15) of the time compared to riders with their own
   bike, 51% (95% CI 49-52).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although above the national average, bicycle helmet use in
   Montreal is still considerably low given that the majority of cyclists
   do not wear a helmet. Injury Prevention Programs could target the entire
   cyclist population, but special attention may be warranted in specific
   groups such as young men, visible minorities, BIXI riders, and those
   riding in tourist areas. Additionally, a collaborative enterprise with
   the bicycle sharing system BIXI Montreal could prove to be fruitful in
   addressing the availability of bike helmets for BIXI riders.

TI Coupling Structural Complexity Management and System Dynamics to

SO 2013 7TH ANNUAL IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (SYSCON 2013)
BP 414
EP 419
PD 2013
PY 2013
AB Product development processes exhibit increasing dynamic behavior, as
   for instance time to market needs to be decreased while the number of
   variants as well as employee turnover increases. During the time,
   various modeling tools have been developed for the management of product
   development processes. But these tools are usually not able to cope with
   their dynamic behavior. On the other hand, various approaches exist to
   illustrate the dynamic behavior such as the System Dynamics methodology.
   Both approaches are independent and offer various benefits, but the link
   how dynamic aspects influence the underlying structure and thereby
   increase the complexity of product development processes on a detailed
   level is still object to research. Therefore, we suggest the coupling of
   the Structural Complexity Management (StCM) methodology with the System
   Dynamics methodology. This offers the possibility to relate, simulate
   and manage dynamic influences on product development processes on a
   structural level. This would enable an optimization of product
   development process towards a more robust and reliable dynamic behavior.
   Within this paper, as a first step, the transformation method from
   multiple domain matrices (MDM) to System Dynamics models is described.
   Rework cycles are identified as main elements for the transformation.
   Furthermore, a qualitative System Dynamics model of an e-bike sharing
   system development process, derived from MDMs, is presented. With this
   coupling, dynamic influencing factors can be related to their result on
   the structure of the product development process. This would allow for
   an early projection of the performance of the development system over
   time, based on its structure.

AB BACKGROUND: High prevalence of physical inactivity contributes to
   adverse health outcomes. Active transportation (cycling or walking) is
   associated with better health outcomes, and bike-sharing programs can
   help communities increase use of active transportation.
   COMMUNITY CONTEXT: The Minneapolis Health Department funded the Nice
   Ride Minnesota bike share system to expand to the Near North community
   in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Near North is a diverse, low-income area of
   the city where residents experience health disparities, including
   disparities in physical activity levels.
   METHODS: The installation of new bike share kiosks in Near North
   resulted in an environmental change to support physical activity.
   Community engagement was conducted pre-intervention only and consisted
   of focus groups, community meetings, and interviews. Postintervention
   data on bike share trips and subscribers were collected to assess
   intervention effectiveness.
   OUTCOME: Focus group participants offered insights on facilitators and
   barriers to bike share and suggested system improvements. Community
   engagement efforts showed that Near North residents were positive about
   Nice Ride and wanted to use the system; however, the numbers of trips
   and subscriptions in Near North were low.
   INTERPRETATION: Results show that the first season of the expansion was
   moderately successful in improving outreach efforts and adapting bike
   share to meet the needs of low-income populations. However,
   environmental change without adequate, ongoing community engagement may
   not be sufficient to result in behavior change.

   freight is already widespread, though restricted to larger cities, which
   have the density necessary to create demand. The existing firms that use
   cycle freight operate primarily as pure cycle freight operators. The
   parallel operation of cargo cycles within fleets of otherwise motorized
   vehicles has, however, been tried successfully on several occasions. The
   availability of city center hubs that ensure the necessary efficiency is
   one of the special requirements associated with the use of cargo cycles.
   Customers still have reservations, although it may be assumed that these
   reservations are more a case of initial resistance and could be overcome
   through information and advertising campaigns. In total, it is expected
   that around a quarter of city center freight transport could be carried
   by bike. Bike freight will work only if this mode of delivery is given
   greater consideration in city and transport planning. Initial estimates
   indicate that the reduction in air and noise pollution created by
   cycle-based commercial traffic could be quite significant, although
   systematic analysis is lacking in this area. To date, there have been no
   studies on the effects of cycle freight on city center traffic.

AB This work develops a bikeway network design model for cycling in urban
   areas. The objectives of the proposed model are to minimize cyclist
   risk, maximize cyclist comfort, maximize service coverage for residents,
   and minimize the impact of the bikeway on existing traffic. The proposed
   model considers the following constraints: bikeway type, monetary
   budgets, path continuities, and value ranges of decision variables. Grey
   numbers are employed to deal with parameter uncertainties, and the
   proposed model is developed as a multi-objective grey 0-1 programming
   problem. A case study of the Xinyi District, Taipei City, is conducted.
   The grey one-stage algorithm is applied to solve this problem. In total,
   six non-dominated alternatives are generated for the case study. In
   comparing model alternatives with the existing network, this work
   confirms that the existing biking network prioritizes cyclist comfort.
   Scenario analyses indicate that maintaining the lower bound of the
   length percentage of wooded areas at 20-40 % generates better
   performance than that of the other scenarios, while decreasing the
   number of traffic accidents only decreases cyclist risk and does not
   alter the other objectives. The proposed model is the first network
   design model for bikeways in literature and will assist bikeway planners
   in developing alternatives for further evaluation and in developing
   detailed designs efficiently and systematically.

AB As a cost-effective, healthy, and environmentally friendly personal mode
   of transportation, electric bicycles (E-bikes) are gaining an increasing
   market share from conventional bicycles and automobiles in urban
   communities. At the same time, the simple structure, high torque and
   power density, as well as low cost of switched reluctance machines (SRM)
   make them a strong candidate for E-bikes. This paper presents a 3-phase,
   external-rotor SRM with 6 stator poles and 10 rotor poles (6-10),
   designed for an E-bike application. The SRM design and simulation is
   initiated by evaluation of the bicycle kinematics. Analytic estimates
   are used to determine machine main dimensions and output power equation,
   followed by comprehensive finite element analysis (FEA). A torque ripple
   reduction control is presented and detailed thermal analysis conducted
   to improve the design.

AB The topic of safe routes to school has been researched since the 1970s,
   and safe routes to school have been a goal of government programs since
   1997. Despite the improvements made because of these efforts, the share
   of students walking and biking continues to decline. Identified barriers
   include parents' concerns about safety, the environment, time, and
   external factors such as traffic, weather, and distance. This research
   suggests that planners have overlooked two important factors influencing
   distance: education movements since the 1950s for greater school choice
   and affordable housing policies. Beyond desegregation, the creation of
   magnet schools, vouchers, academies, charter schools, and other school
   options has resulted in growing shares of urban students traveling long
   distances to school. In Oakland, California, only 49% of students attend
   school in the neighborhood where they live, and another 10,228 attend 34
   charter schools with countywide enrollment. U.S. housing policies have
   also changed. Construction of public housing has ceased, save for the
   construction of replacement units. Housing voucher programs are
   oversubscribed, and individuals with vouchers often change neighborhoods
   or cities to find a unit. Foreclosures, high prices, and low vacancy
   rates in cities have also limited housing availability. School and
   housing policies combined have eroded the economic location theory, in
   which families balance housing and transportation costs to be near work
   and good schools. The study uses surveys, time use diaries, and
   interviews with 70 Oakland parents or caregivers. Results identify the
   complex choices that affect school travel and offer potential ways for
   transport, land use, and education planners to coordinate active travel
   to school.

AB The availability of urban green space (UGS) is one of the environmental
   factors that is frequently linked to increased levels of physical
   activity (PA). Positive associations with increased levels of PA are
   reported for the amount of UGS close to home, the distance to the
   nearest UGS, the size of the nearest UGS, and the presence of certain
   features. However, the evidence to date is somewhat inconclusive, and
   dominated by studies from North America and Australia. There is a large
   variation in city structures, and recommendations for North American or
   Australian cities are not automatically valid for European cities. Using
   a sample of 1305 Danish adults and detailed descriptions of UGS, we
   examined the association between UGS and outdoor PA in general, as well
   as PA in the nearest UGS. No association between outdoor PA in general,
   size of, distance to, and number of features in the nearest UGS was
   found. The amount and number of UGS within 1 km revealed no association
   either. For PA in the nearest UGS positive associations with size,
   walking/cycling routes, wooded areas, water features, lights, pleasant
   views, bike rack, and parking lot were found. This indicates that PA in
   a UGS might be stimulated by providing these features there. However,
   interventions or longitudinal studies are needed to explore potential
   causal relationship. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB The compatibility between an agenda for sustainable urban development
   and the neoliberal economic restructuring of urban space has been
   observed within cities in developed countries across the globe. From
   providing economic support to local 'green' industries to creating bike
   lanes, municipalities develop sustainability strategies that are
   designed to boost their competitive advantage. Moreover, municipalities
   are responding to demands from popular social movements and national
   governments that seek to reconfigure societal relationships with the
   natural environment in cities. Cities are increasingly understood not as
   part of the ecological crisis but as part of the solution, or as places
   where alternative patterns of sustainable consumption and new socially
   and ecologically responsible industries can be developed. Over the last
   decade in Austin, environmental sustainability has become an uncontested
   paradigm that has progressively shaped the city's urban space and
   policy. Two competing conceptualizations of the environment, so-called
   'environmental' and 'just' sustainability groups, are explored in this
   article. I demonstrate how the notion of environmental sustainability
   has been selectively incorporated into the hegemonic vision of Austin's
   strategic growth plan. I argue that the dominance of this
   conceptualization is best understood by asking what counts as the
   'environment' for environmentalists, and understanding the unstated
   assumptions about the environment shared by the business community and
   environmentalists.

AB OBJECTIVES: To obtain in-depth community input using qualitative and
   quantitative methods to guide development and marketing of a bike-share
   program in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
   METHOD: Focus groups and surveys assessed bicycling attitudes, beliefs,
   barriers, and behaviors of residents, workers, and university students.
   The authors completed nine focus groups (N = 56): five sessions with
   downtown workers, three with downtown residents, and one with university
   students.
   RESULTS: Health, recreation and transportation benefits of bicycling
   were commonly identified. Concerns regarding bicycling in traffic are
   apparent because of lack of facilities and a need for public education
   on safe motorist and bicyclist behavior. Practical limitations can
   inhibit bicycling during the day, including shower access and personal
   hygiene concerns.
   CONCLUSIONS: Public desire for environmental, educational, and
   enforcement tactics to support safe bicycling was noted. Marketing
   tactics for bike-share usage should emphasize health, recreational, and
   transportation benefits. Worksites can reduce barriers related to
   bicycling and encourage bike-share use. Future studies should assess
   bike-share impact on perceptions and behavior, as well as the resulting
   policy and environmental changes.

AB To deal with the serious impact on urban traffic, society, ecological
   environment and energy system by the aggregated motorization in cities,
   both China and foreign countries have gradually come up with a series of
   policies and initiatives targeting at the non-motorized traffic by
   cyclists and pedestrians. Under such a background, the research studies
   four sub-districts of Tuanjie hu, Hujialou, Liulitun and Balizhuang at
   the central area of Chaoyang District, Beijing, and tries to find the
   interrelation between the preferences of non-motorized agents in densely
   populated urban central area and the construction of non-motorized
   transportation network. By discussing the non-motorized travel routes,
   road patterns and facility layout according to various needs of the
   target group, the research aims to deal with the construction of
   non-motorized transportation system in the densely populated central
   area in Beijing. Through questionnaire and interview, the research
   conducts an in-depth survey on residents' travel purposes, behavioral
   regularities and user's assessment for the current non-motorized routes,
   and acquires an understanding about their preferences on choice of roads
   due to different travel purposes, problems from using current
   non-motorized routes and thereby their preferred road patterns, and the
   preferred facility layout that meet local residents' behavioral
   regularities. By simulating the optimization of two types of
   non-motorized routes for commute and recreation with the Cost Distance
   Module, the research constructs three types of non-motorized routes:
   comprehensive, commute and recreation, with a total length of 65.8km.
   The research also reconstructs the road patterns for urban expressway,
   major arterial, minor arterial and connector on the road section for
   commute and recreation, adding green belts and low road fence to segment
   non-motorized routes. Meanwhile, the research establishes a three-tier
   NMT facility service center system which incorporates bicycle service
   (ranging from bike renting, parking and maintenance to vehicle shift),
   NMT signs, informational signs, vendor booths, public bathrooms,
   benches, and trash bins. Thus an integral non-motorized traffic network
   at the urban central area of Beijing is built up.

   city area. The primary objective of this study is to analyze the
   residents' travel activity patterns in historic urban area. Based on
   survey data conducted in the historic urban area of Yangzhou, the travel
   activities of local residents in a whole day were classified into five
   types of patterns. The multinomial logit (MNL) model was developed to
   evaluate the impacts of explanatory variables on the choices of activity
   patterns. The results showed that the choice of activity pattern was
   significantly impacted by five contributing factors including the
   gender, age, occupation, car ownership, and number of electric bikes in
   household. The other variables, which were the family population,
   preschoolers, number of conventional bikes in household, motorcycle
   ownership, and income, were found to be not significantly related to the
   choice of activities. The results of this study from historic urban area
   were compared to findings of previous studies from overall urban area.
   The comparison showed that the impacts of factors on activity pattern in
   the historic urban area were different from those in the overall area.
   Findings of this study provide important suggestions for the policy
   makings to improve the traffic situations in historic urban areas of

AB The interaction design of games pay more attention to the information
   interfaces, but overlooks the players' preference, which leads to
   usability problems for them. The problems include hand rigid, pain, and
   lack of exercise and so on. The players' preferences are closely
   connected with the interaction form, and interaction function. Thus,
   topics about how to improve the product's usefulness are in much need
   for discussing. Nowadays, it is a shared dream that people can enjoy
   life in the highly stressed society. Therefore, the digital technology
   can be used in bike interaction design, then, simulate the interaction
   between the game and bicycle as well as stimulating the users to
   participate in the sports actively. It can create a new kind of sports
   experience to achieve a mutual beneficial interaction between games and
   players. In addition, bicycle has the advantage of activating the whole
   body and less likely injuring the body, which is an unique
   characteristic that video games do not have. Therefore, this paper will
   firstly summarize the interaction forms of game bicycle: the
   somatosensory steering, sense of speed, and virtual reality devices;
   secondly, the construction of the experiment platform; thirdly, access
   the interaction function by the interviewing after the experiment
   (subjective assessment) and measuring the heart rate (objective
   assessment). In the interview part, each device in terms of the
   cognitive, affectivity, usefulness, and satisfaction are all good enough
   in interaction function; and in the heart rate measurement part, each
   device has a good exercises function.

AB To better understand bicyclists' preferences for facility types, GPS
   units were used to observe the behavior of 164 cyclists in Portland,
   Oregon, USA for several days each. Trip purpose and several other
   trip-level variables recorded by the cyclists, and the resulting trips
   were coded to a highly detailed bicycle network. The authors used the
   1449 non-exercise, utilitarian trips to estimate a bicycle route choice
   model. The model used a choice set generation algorithm based on
   multiple permutations of path attributes and was formulated to account
   for overlapping route alternatives. The findings suggest that cyclists
   are sensitive to the effects of distance, turn frequency, slope,
   intersection control (e.g. presence or absence of traffic signals), and
   traffic volumes. In addition, cyclists appear to place relatively high
   value on off-street bike paths, enhanced neighborhood bikeways with
   traffic calming features (aka "bicycle boulevards"), and bridge
   facilities. Bike lanes more or less exactly offset the negative effects
   of adjacent traffic, but were no more or less attractive than a basic
   low traffic volume street. Finally, route preferences differ between
   commute and other utilitarian trips: cyclists were more sensitive to
   distance and less sensitive to other infrastructure characteristics for
   commute trips. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. We compared cycling injury risks of 14 route types and other
   route infrastructure features.
   Methods. We recruited 690 city residents injured while cycling in
   Toronto or Vancouver, Canada. A case-crossover design compared route
   infrastructure at each injury site to that of a randomly selected
   control site from the same trip.
   Results. Of 14 route types, cycle tracks had the lowest risk (adjusted
   odds ratio [OR] = 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.02, 0.54),
   about one ninth the risk of the reference: major streets with parked
   cars and no bike infrastructure. Risks on major streets were lower
   without parked cars (adjusted OR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.41, 0.96) and with
   bike lanes (adjusted OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.29, 1.01). Local streets also
   had lower risks (adjusted OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.31, 0.84). Other
   infrastructure characteristics were associated with increased risks:
   streetcar or train tracks (adjusted OR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.8, 5.1),
   downhill grades (adjusted OR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.7, 3.1), and construction
   (adjusted OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.3, 2.9).
   Conclusions. The lower risks on quiet streets and with bike-specific
   infrastructure along busy streets support the route-design approach used
   in many northern European countries. Transportation infrastructure with
   lower bicycling injury risks merits public health support to reduce
   injuries and promote cycling. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:2336-2343.

AB Objective: Estimate the health risks and benefits of mode shifts from
   car to cycling and public transport in the metropolitan area of
   Barcelona, Spain.
   Methods: We conducted a health impact assessment (HIA), creating 8
   different scenarios on the replacement of short and long car trips, by
   public transport or/and bike. The primary outcome measure was all-cause
   mortality and change in life expectancy related to two different
   assessments: A) the exposure of travellers to physical activity, air
   pollution to particulate matter <2.5 mu m (PM2.5), and road traffic
   fatality; and B) the exposure of general population to PM2.5, modelling
   by Barcelona Air-Dispersion Model. The secondary outcome was a change in
   emissions of carbon dioxide.
   Results: The annual health impact of a shift of 40% of the car trips,
   starting and ending in Barcelona City, to cycling (n = 141,690) would be
   for the travellers who shift modes 1.15 additional deaths from air
   pollution, 0.17 additional deaths from road traffic fatality and 67.46
   deaths avoided from physical activity resulting in a total of 6612
   deaths avoided. Fewer deaths would be avoided annually if half of the
   replaced trips were shifted to public transport (43.76 deaths). The
   annual health impact in the Barcelona City general population
   (n=1.630,494) of the 40% reduction in car trips would be 10.03 deaths
   avoided due to the reduction of 0.64% in exposure to PM2.5. The deaths
   (including travellers and general population) avoided in Barcelona City
   therefore would be 76.15 annually. Further health benefits would be
   obtained with a shift of 40% of the car trips from the Greater Barcelona
   Metropolitan which either start or end in Barcelona City to public
   transport (40.15 deaths avoided) or public transport and cycling (98.50
   deaths avoided). The carbon dioxide reduction for shifting from car to
   other modes of transport (bike and public transport) in Barcelona
   metropolitan area was estimated to be 203251 t/CO2 emissions per year.
   Conclusions: Interventions to reduce car use and increase cycling and
   the use of public transport in metropolitan areas, like Barcelona, can
   produce health benefits for travellers and for the general population of
   the city. Also these interventions help to reduce green house gas
   emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A growing number of cities are implementing bike-sharing programs to
   increase bicycle use. One of the key factors for the success of such
   programs is the location of bike stations in relation to potential
   demand (population, activities and public transport stations). This
   study proposes a GIS-based method to calculate the spatial distribution
   of the potential demand for trips, locate stations using
   location-allocation models, determine station capacity and define the
   characteristics of the demand for stations. The results obtained are
   compared with the most commonly used location-allocation modeling
   approaches: minimizing impedance and maximizing coverage. For the
   objective of this study, the latter approach is more useful. Diminishing
   returns are observed in both cases: as the number of stations increases,
   there is less improvement in the fraction of the population covered and
   accessibility to stations. Because the spatial structure of the proposed
   network also plays an important role in bike-station use, an additional
   accessibility analysis was carried out to calculate the volume of
   activity to which a station has access. With this analysis, stations
   that are relatively isolated, and therefore of little use to potential
   users, can be eliminated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore barriers and facilitators to
   using CityCycle, a public bicycle share scheme in Brisbane, Australia.
   Focus groups were conducted with participants belonging to one of three
   categories. Group one consisted of infrequent and noncyclists (no
   bicycle riding over the past month), group two were regular bicycle
   riders (ridden a bicycle at least once in the past month) and group
   three was composed of CityCycle members. A thematic analytic method was
   used to analyse the data. Three main themes were found:
   Accessibility/spontaneity, safety and weather/topography. The lengthy
   sign-up process was thought to stifle the spontaneity typically thought
   to attract people to public bike share. Mandatory helmet legislation was
   thought to reduce spontaneous use. Safety was a major concern for all
   groups and this included a perceived lack of suitable bicycle
   infrastructure, as well as regular riders describing a negative attitude
   of some car drivers. Interestingly, CityCycle riders unanimously
   perceived car driver attitudes to improve when on CityCycle bicycles
   relative to riding on personal bicycles. Conclusions: In order to
   increase the popularity of the CityCycle scheme, the results of this
   study suggest that a more accessible, spontaneous sign-up process is
   required, 24/7 opening hours, and greater incentives to sign up new
   members and casual users, as seeing people using CityCycle appears
   critical to further take up. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the reported research was to examine the perceptions of road
   user safety amongst different road users and examine the link between
   attitudes, empathy and skill in motorcycle safety behaviour.
   Motorcyclists were perceived by the study participants, members of the
   public at four different locations at the UK (including motorcyclists
   and non-motorcyclists), as a group be at a high risk of accidents on the
   road. This was due to perceived behavioural characteristics of
   motorcyclists - who were viewed as 'thrill seekers' - as well as
   observed behaviours on the road. This, coupled with the physical
   vulnerability and excessive speeds, meant that motorbike driving was
   considered by the study participants as the least safe form of road use.
   There was broad agreement that motorcycling was dangerous as a whole,
   but not all motorcyclists were necessarily risky riders. The issue of
   'competitive space' emerged between car drivers and motorcyclists in
   particular and it was suggested that there was a lack of mutual
   awareness and considerations between the two groups. Generally, greatest
   empathy comes from drivers who are motorcyclists themselves.
   Engineering, education, enforcement interventions were investigated.
   These were aimed at two main areas: normalising safer driving behaviours
   for motorcyclists and increasing awareness of bikes for
   motorists-particularly in relation to reducing speed limits at urban
   junctions. Finally, the idea of risk mapping and reduced speed limits on
   rural roads was seen as potentially effective particularly as certain
   motorcyclists highlighted that they changed their riding behaviours by
   increasing speed and taking greater risks on these roads. (C) 2011

AB Background: Downtown Wilkes-Barre, a town of 40,000 residents in
   Northeast Pennsylvania, and the hub of a planned urban, suburban, and
   rural trail network, was the site of a number of changes to improve
   walkability during the Active Living by Design (ALbD) grant period.
   Purpose: The Wyoming Valley Wellness Trails Partnership and Greater
   Wilkes-Barre Chamber of Business and Industry initiated the Wilkes-Barre
   Downtown Bicycle and Pedestrian Count (Bike-Ped Count) in order to pilot
   bicycle and pedestrian counting methods and to evaluate downtown built
   environment and policy changes.
   Methods: The Bike-Ped Count was conducted during nine 2-hour counting
   periods over 4 days :in September using screen-line count methods at
   seven locations downtown and at River Common Park.
   Results: During 18 hours of counting, staff noted 15,347 pedestrians and
   773 bicyclists. The largest average number of pedestrians (512) was
   observed during lunch hours, whereas the largest numbers of bicyclists
   were observed during evening and weekend hours.
   Conclusions: The Bike-Ped Count illustrates patterns of bicycling and
   walking downtown and allows comparisons of bicycling and walking among
   locations, including different cities. In the future, counts will help
   show how ongoing changes to the downtown environment affect walking and
   bicycling. (Am J Prey Med 2012;43(5S4):S399-S402) (C) 2012 American

AB The number of policy initiatives to promote the use of bike, or the
   combined use of bicycle and public transport for one trip, has grown
   considerably over the past decade as part of the search for more
   sustainable transport solutions. This paper presents an optimization
   formulation to design a bike-sharing system for travel inside small
   communities, or as a means to extend public transport for access and
   egress trips. The mathematical model attempts to optimize a bike-sharing
   system by determining the minimum required bike fleet size that
   minimizes simultaneously unmet demand, unutilized bikes, and the need to
   transport empty bikes between rental stations to meet demand. The
   proposed approach is applied to an example problem and is shown to be
   successful, ultimately providing a new managerial tool for planning and
   analyzing bike utilization more effectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Traffic counts and models for describing use of non-motorized facilities
   such as sidewalks, trails, and bike lanes are generally unavailable.
   Because officials lack the data and tools needed to estimate use of
   facilities, their ability to make evidence-based choices among
   investment alternatives is limited. This paper (1) summarizes counts of
   cyclists and pedestrians between 2007 and 2010 at 259 locations in the
   city of Minneapolis, MN, (2) develops scaling factors for estimating
   12-h (6:30 am-6:30 pm) "daily" counts from hourly counts, (3) presents
   models for estimating non-motorized traffic using ordinary least squares
   and negative binomial regressions, (4) validates each model using
   bicycle and pedestrian counts for 85 locations, and (5) estimates
   non-motorized traffic for every street in Minneapolis, MN. Across all
   locations, mean pedestrian traffic (51/h) exceeded mean bicycle traffic
   (38/h) by 35%. One-hour counts were highly correlated with 12-h "daily"
   counts suggesting that planners may focus on short time scales without
   compromising data quality. Significant correlates of non-motorized
   traffic vary by mode and model and include weather (temperature,
   precipitation), neighborhood socio-demographics (household income,
   education), built environment characteristics (land use mix), and street
   (or bicycle facility) type. When controlling for these factors, bicycle
   traffic increased over time and was higher on streets with bicycle
   facilities than without (and highest on off-street facilities). Our
   models can be used by policy-makers to estimate non-motorized traffic
   for streets where counts are unavailable or to estimate changes in
   non-motorized traffic associated with other changes in the built
   environment (e.g., adding bicycle lanes or changing land use). (C) 2012

AB Background: The aim of this study was to estimate use of helmets,
   lights, and visible clothing among cyclists and to examine trip and
   personal characteristics associated with their use.
   Methods: Using data from a study of transportation infrastructure and
   injuries to 690 adult cyclists in Toronto and Vancouver, Canada, we
   examined the proportion who used bike lights, conspicuous clothing on
   the torso, and helmets on their injury trip. Multiple logistic
   regression was used to examine associations between personal and trip
   characteristics and each type of safety equipment.
   Results: Bike lights were the least frequently used (20% of all trips)
   although they were used on 77% of trips at night. Conspicuous clothing
   (white, yellow, orange, red) was worn on 33% of trips. Helmets were used
   on 69% of trips, 76% in Vancouver where adult helmet use is required by
   law and 59% in Toronto where it is not. Factors positively associated
   with bike light use included night, dawn and dusk trips, poor weather
   conditions, weekday trips, male sex, and helmet use. Factors positively
   associated with conspicuous clothing use included good weather
   conditions, older age, and more frequent cycling. Factors positively
   associated with helmet use included bike light use, longer trip
   distances, hybrid bike type, not using alcohol in the 6 hours prior to
   the trip, female sex, older age, higher income, and higher education.
   Conclusions: In two of Canada's largest cities, helmets were the most
   widely used safety equipment. Measures to increase use of visibility
   aids on both daytime and night-time cycling trips may help prevent
   crashes.

AB Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to explore possible

   Design: Qualitative design, specifically an inductive-deductive approach
   informed by reversal theory, was used to analyze participation
   motivation data.
   Method: Data was collected using the Scanlan Collaborative Interview
   Method (SCIM; Scanlan, Russell, Wilson, & Scanlan, 2003). Participants
   were very experienced adventure sport participants involved in
   riversurfing, mountain biking, kayaking, mountain climbing and hang
   gliding.
   Results: The results indicated that the participants' motivation was
   multifaceted. While some participants shared common motives, these were
   often described in different orders of importance by different
   participants. The range of motives for adventure sport participation
   found included: goal achievement, risk taking, social motivation, escape
   from boredom, pushing personal boundaries and overcoming fear, is well
   as connecting with the natural environment, and pleasurable kinaesthetic
   bodily sensations from moving in water or air.
   Conclusions: The authors argue for a continuation of a recent trend to
   provide a more comprehensive picture of the complexities of human
   motivation for participation in adventure sports which go beyond
   excitement- or thrill-seeking behaviour. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

AB BACKGROUND
   For many health-related behaviors and outcomes, racial and ethnic
   disparities among adolescents are well documented, but less is known
   about health-related disparities during preadolescence.
   METHODS
   We studied 5119 randomly selected public-school fifth-graders and their
   parents in three metropolitan areas in the United States. We examined
   differences among black, Latino, and white children on 16 measures,
   including witnessing of violence, peer victimization, perpetration of
   aggression, seat-belt use, bike-helmet use, substance use,
   discrimination, terrorism worries, vigorous exercise, obesity, and
   self-rated health status and psychological and physical quality of life.
   We tested potential mediators of racial and ethnic disparities (i.e.,
   sociodemographic characteristics and the child's school) using partially
   adjusted models.
   RESULTS
   There were significant differences between black children and white
   children for all 16 measures and between Latino children and white
   children for 12 of 16 measures, although adjusted analyses reduced many
   of these disparities. For example, in un-adjusted analysis, the rate of
   witnessing a threat or injury with a gun was higher among blacks (20%)
   and Latinos (11%) than among whites (5%), and the number of days per
   week on which the student performed vigorous exercise was lower among
   blacks (3.56 days) and Latinos (3.77 days) than among whites (4.33 days)
   (P<0.001 for all comparisons). After statistical adjustment, these
   differences were reduced by about half between blacks and whites and
   were eliminated between Latinos and whites. Household income, household
   highest education level, and the child's school were the most
   substantial mediators of racial and ethnic disparities.
   CONCLUSIONS
   We found that harmful health behaviors, experiences, and outcomes were
   more common among black children and Latino children than among white
   children. Adjustment for socioeconomic status and the child's school
   substantially reduced most of these differences. Interventions that
   address potentially detrimental consequences of low socioeconomic status
   and adverse school environments may help reduce racial and ethnic
   differences in child health. (Funded by the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention.)

AB This article analyses the travel behaviour, residential choices and
   related preferences of 55+ baby boomers in suburban Boston, USA, looking
   specifically at age-restricted neighbourhoods. For this highly
   auto-dependent group, do neighbourhood-related characteristics influence
   local-level recreational walk/bike and social activity trip-making? The
   analysis aims to discern community (for example, social network) versus
   physical (for example, street network) influences. Structural equation
   models, incorporating attitudes and residential choice, are used to
   control for self-selection and to account for direct and indirect
   effects among exogenous and endogenous variables. The analysis reveals
   modest neighbourhood effects. Living in age-restricted, as opposed to
   unrestricted, suburban neighbourhoods modestly increases the likelihood
   of residents being active (i.e. making at least one local recreational
   walk/bike trip) and the number of local social trips. Overall, the
   age-restricted community status has greater influence on recreational
   and social activity trip-making than the neighbourhood physical
   characteristics, although some community-neighbourhood interaction
   exists.

AB This paper studies university students commute and housing behaviors
   using samples from Los Angeles, a place notorious for car dependence and
   dominance. It finds that being embedded in this place does not make
   university students drive alone more than their peers in other places.
   Being multimodal and having a discounted transit pass increase the odds
   of alternative modes while holding a parking permit reduces the odds of
   these modes. Commute distance is positively related to carpool and
   telecommuting. Gender, status (undergraduate vs. gradate) and age are
   significantly correlated to biking, walking or public transit. Students
   living alone are more likely to commute by driving alone than other
   students. Having friends and classmates living nearby increases the odds
   of taking public transit. Due to data constraints, this study cannot
   prove whether there is any correlation between information contagion and
   the effects of living alone and having friends and classmates living
   nearby on alternative mode choice. But it proposes that the issue be
   worthwhile of further investigations. Base on the above, the paper
   recommends a comprehensive travel demand management program, utilization
   of information contagion effects of students and promotion of multimodal
   commute to better promote alternative mode of commute among university
   students. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   by alcohol, and the resulting cognitive, functional, and behavioural
   deficits, people with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) are at high
   risk for becoming involved in the legal system, either as offenders or
   as victims, if appropriate diagnosis, interventions and support services
   are not initiated early in life and maintained throughout the

   nineteen times more likely to be imprisoned than youths without FASD, on
   any given day in a specific year. These alarming study findings
   emphasize the need to incorporate screening for FASD as early as
   possible in the criminal justice process. It is crucial to better
   understand the mental disabilities of offenders prenatally exposed to
   alcohol and make appropriate referrals for mental health and other
   services.Vitamin D is a nutritional factor hypothesized to mitigate and
   prevent hypertensive diseases of pregnancy due to its effect on
   placental immunomodulation, vascularisation, and blood pressure
   regulation. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of
   high-dose prenatal vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure during
   the third trimester of pregnancy. A randomized, double-blinded,
   placebo-controlled trial involving 160 pregnant women in the third
   trimester of pregnancy was conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh (2010-2011).
   Participantswere randomized to receive either vitamin D3 (35,000
   IU/week) or placebo until delivery. Blood pressure was measured at five
   timepoints and vitamin D status was assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin
   D concentration. Generalized estimating equations were applied to
   longitudinally compare the change in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP)
   blood pressure over time between the two groups. Participants in the
   vitamin D-supplemented group had statistically insignificant lower rates
   of increase in SBP (-3.2 [-9.0, 2.8] mmHg) and DBP (-2.4 [-7.8, 3.1]
   mmHg) compared to women in the placebo group during follow-up. In
   conclusion, this trial of vitamin D supplementation in pregnant
   Bangladeshi women did not demonstrate a significant effect of high-dose
   vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure during the third trimester
   of pregnancy.Unipolar major depression is one of the top ten
   contributors to global disease burden. Young people transitioning into
   college and university are particularly at risk of developing symptoms
   of stress and depression. The purpose of this research was to identify
   the major risk factors and correlates of depression and stress among
   Canadian and American undergraduate students. The search was conducted
   in the Ovid (Medline) database, using MeSH terms for disease terms
   (mental health, mental disorders, depression, depressive disorders, and
   stress (psychological)); risk terms (risk factors, indicators, and
   determinants; and hedge terms (university, post-secondary, and
   students). Inclusion criteria were country of origin (U.S. and Canada)
   and English language, and exclusion criteria were articles older than 15
   years. The final search included eight articles from which data was
   collected.
   Identified risk factors and correlates of stress and depression were of
   behavioural nature or social or demographic nature. Positive risk
   factors/correlates for depression were marijuana use, social problem
   solving deficits, race [Black/Hispanic/multi-ethnic], smoking, and
   emotional abuse. Inverse risk factors/correlates for depression/stress
   were religiosity/spirituality, social problem solving abilities,
   vigorous physical activity, and social support. Statistically
   significant relationships between positive and negative risk factors and
   correlates, and stress/depression are identified in this
   review.Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are flame retardants with
   widespread exposure. Although PBDEs are known thyroid toxicants in
   animal studies, human studies are sparse, especially during pregnancy
   and infancy when thyroid hormones are critical for early brain
   development. This study will examine associations between PBDE levels in
   maternal serum (at 15 weeks gestation), and thyroid hormones (free T4,
   total T4 and TSH) in both maternal serum (n 152), collected in 2007-2008
   at 15 and 18 weeks gestation) and umbilical cord serum (n 116), using
   data from the Chemicals, Health and Pregnancy (CHirP) Study based in
   Vancouver, Canada. Median PBDE concentrations (ng/g lipid) were 9.1,
   1.6, 1.9 and 3.2 for BDE 47, BDE 99, BDE 100 and BDE 153, respectively,
   and were similar to those in the Canadian population. Final results are
   forthcoming, as this is a proposed Masters thesis. However, PBDEs are
   hypothesized to be positively associated with free T4, and negatively
   associated with TSH - similar to previous studies of women later in
   pregnancy. This study will provide some of the first evidence about the
   thyroid disrupting potential of PBDEs during the most critical window of
   thyroid-mediated fetal brain development, and provide important missing
   information for ongoing risk assessments.The Maternal Mental Health
   Program (MMHP) in Saskatoon, Canada was developed to: 1) improve access
   to and quality of mental health care for preconceptual, pregnant, and
   postpartum women and 2) promote collaboration between a specialist
   mental health team and physicians using a shared care model of service
   delivery. The study evaluated the effects of the MMHP on anxiety and
   depression symptoms, the determinants of these symptoms, and
   participants and physicians satisfaction with the MMHP, using
   established questionnaires and Likert-style surveys. Descriptive and
   logistic regression analyses were performed. Participants included 99
   women who completed the MMHP between 2006 and 2011 and 98 physicians who
   delivered care to childbearing women. There was a significant reduction
   in anxiety and depression symptoms among participants. Symptoms were
   associated with the social determinants of health. The majority of women
   (n 75, 75.8) and physicians (n 75, 93.7) were satisfied with the MMHP,
   in particular with: 1) accessibility, 2) comfort and skill level in
   treating maternal mental health patients, and 3) support from and
   competency of the staff. The MMHP exemplifies a shared care model in
   practice; however, to improve the mental health of women overall, the
   social determinants of health must also be addressed.Massage therapists
   (MTs) are increasingly becoming important providers of health and
   wellness care. Conducted in Saskatchewan, Canada in 20092010 the study
   aimed to determine if massage therapists held positive or negative
   attitudes toward research and to explore the association between
   attributes of providers and reported use of research.
   The study was conducted in two phases using a sequential explanatory
   mixed methods design. In phase one, a mail-out survey was sent to all
   815 members of the Massage Therapist Association of Saskatchewan (MTAS).
   In phase two, interviews with six members further explored their
   attitudes toward research. Survey data was analyzed using SPSS.
   Univariate and logistic regression analysis was conducted. Qualitative
   data was explored using thematic content analysis. Forty-one percent of
   the questionnaires were completed and returned. Survey results revealed
   that most study participants held positive attitudes toward research.
   The factors most strongly associated with self-reported research use
   included a positive attitude toward research-based practice and
   searching research databases. While case study participants attitudes
   toward research were largely positive they described experiencing some
   frustration with accessing and understanding research. Greater emphasis
   on research literacy training in pre-service and continuing education is
   necessary to support massage therapists in using research their
   work.Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) is used in breast reconstruction
   surgery to increase implant expansion and improve capsular
   reinforcement. The objective was to conduct a systematic review and
   meta-analysis to assess the risk of postoperative complications in
   patients using ADM in implant-based reconstruction. Electronic databases
   and health technology assessment reports were searched. Meta-analysis
   was performed of the risk ratios of complications reported in studies
   that compared ADM to conventional reconstruction. There were 27 cohort
   studies and one systematic review eligible for inclusion published since
   2005. The pooled risk of any complication with ADM was 20.8 (95
   confidence interval [CI] 15.3, 27.7). The meta-analysis of nine
   comparative studies showed that ADM use was associated with a higher
   risk of implant loss (risk ratio [RR] 3.98; 95 CI 1.96, 8.11) infection
   without implant removal (RR 2.49; 95 CI 1.4, 14.37) and seroma (RR 2.72;
   95 CI 1.75, 4.23), and lower risk of capsular contracture (RR 0.3; 95 CI
   0.09, 0.998), compared to conventional reconstruction. The evidence
   suggests that there is a higher risk of certain types of complications
   with ADM use compared to non-ADM use. Further research is needed to
   assess the aesthetic outcomes of breast reconstruction surgeries using
   ADM.Social network patterns influence risk behaviors for HIV and other
   infectious diseases. This study hypothesizes that condom use is related
   to the closeness of participants to social network members, length of
   time known and multiple roles. Using respondent driven sampling, social
   network data were collected from underhoused people, sex workers, people
   who use drugs, and street youth (n 226) from Ottawa, Canada in 2010.
   Social network members who provided support but engaged in risky
   drug/sex behavior were defined as onegative support.' Stratified by
   recruitment tree, condom behavior and social network relationship
   associations were tested by (2). 31.0 of participants were female, 86.6
   were Caucasian, 54.9 had less than high school education, and 73.0 were
   sexually active in the last 6 months. The mean age was 41.4 years (SD
   10.6). A greater likelihood of using condoms was significantly
   associated with a lower proportion of negative support social network
   members known for greater than one year (P 0.04) and modestly associated
   with the absence of a negative support social network member with
   multiple roles (P 0.08).
   Future work will determine whether these variables are independent
   predictors of condom use. Studying the quality of relationships
   strengthens interventions that mobilize social support for health
   protection.This paper uses data from Smart Cities Healthy Kids
   (www.smartcitieshealthykids.ca), an ongoing mixed methods, population
   health intervention study which aims to understand the influence of
   neighborhood built environment on childrens physical activity.
   Neighborhoods of Saskatoon were categorized into 3 development eras
   based on their urban form and vintage. Built environment data were
   collected using replicable observation tools. A questionnaire was
   administered to children to capture their perception of factors that
   influence their physical activity. In the summer of 2010, for one
   continuous week, Actical accelerometers were used to measure physical
   activity of 455 children aged 10-14 years. Moderate to vigorous physical
   activity (MVPA) was derived from accelerometer data and used as the
   outcome variable. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 19 and
   HLM 7. Robust differences were observed in MVPA accumulation with high
   values during school days and low values during weekend days. Based on
   this pattern, MVPA was categorized into school days and weekend days,
   and multilevel models were fitted for each category. Determinants of
   MVPA varied between school days and weekend days. Density of
   destinations, which was previously reported to improve the likelihood of
   physical activity in adults, was detrimental in children, suggesting a
   differential built environment impact.Prevalence of childhood obesity
   and overweight has increased two- to three-fold within a generation in
   Canada and in the United States; this has attracted serious public
   health concern. The study examined the impact of neighborhood design and
   specific built environment factors on active transportation to school
   among children 1014 years in the city of Saskatoon, Canada. Neighborhood
   Active Living Potential tool and the Irvine-Minnesota Inventory were
   used to determine the built environment factors within a range of
   neighborhood designs, from grid pattern, mixed grid to curvilinear
   pattern. A self-reported questionnaire collected data from 1610 children
   on modes of transport to school and other places, and a range of active
   transportation determinants. Multilevel logistic regression analysis
   estimated adjusted associations. The children are more likely to report
   that they walk or bike to school, if they are: boys, from higher SES
   families, older, and have more siblings. In addition, children from
   neighborhoods with high-density, grid-pattern road network are more
   likely to report active transportation; the further the neighborhoods
   from the grid-pattern core, the less likely were the children to engage
   in active transportation. Safety has a significant influence on the use
   of active transportation. There is a need for tailored policy
   intervention to improve safety and childrens activity friendly
   neighborhoods.The live-birth prevalence of Down syndrome (DS) has either
   declined or stabilized in many countries, despite the increase in the
   average age of mothers. Studies have linked lower DS live birth rates to
   the introduction and expansion of prenatal screening programs, however
   little is known about its impact in Canada. A population-based,
   prospective, cohort was compiled drawing from regional and provincial
   databases, and included all pregnancies to Saskatchewan residents from
   20002005.
   To assess the impact of ToPFCA on live birth DS rates, the authors
   calculated annual rates that included and excluded DS-affected
   pregnancies terminated following prenatal screening/diagnosis. Of cases
   diagnosed during pregnancy, 73 of Down Syndrome cases were terminated
   (12.6 of all DS cases). The birth prevalence and birth incidence rates
   increasingly diverged from 11.7 and 11.7 per 10,000 births in 2000
   respectively; 12.5 and 13.2 in 2001; 14.6 and 15.4 in 2002; 14.4 and
   16.8 in 2003; 15.2 and 18.4 in 2004; 14.4 and 17.7 in 2005. The average
   annual percent increase was 3.8 for the live birth trend line over the
   6-year period and 7.4 for the incidence line. Study results provide
   evidence that the practice of ToPFCA lowered the annual DS live birth
   rate from 2001 and forward. The greatest impediment to basic CA
   surveillance in Canada is the national surveillance systems in ability
   to capture ToPFCA, which prevents systematic investigation of risk
   factors and trends in maternal, perinatal, and infant health.Asthma is a
   common chronic condition in children. Vitamin D provides immunity
   against infections resulting in decreased asthma exacerbation. The
   objective of the study was to determine the association of vitamin D
   level with current wheeze and lung function parameters. The Canadian
   Health Measures Survey is a cross-national survey conducted by
   Statistics Canada in 20072009. The presence of current wheeze was
   determined from the questionnaire. Serum vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D
   [nmol/L]) level was categorized into 49, 5074 (moderate), and epsilon
   75. Logistic and linear regression incorporating survey design and
   bootstrap weights were used. In total 1,213 children (males 52.5;
   females 47.4) of ages 6 to 12 years participated in the study.
   Prevalence of current wheeze was 11.4, 4.1, and 7.1 among lower,
   moderate, and higher vitamin D categories, respectively. After
   controlling for potential confounders both the lower and higher
   categories were associated with current wheeze compared to moderate
   category (OR: 3.26; 95 CI: 1.169.17 and OR: 2.14; 95 CI: 1.074.28,
   respectively). Lung function parameters varied significantly between
   vitamin D levels with the highest mean values observed in the moderate
   category. Optimal respiratory outcomes observed in moderate vitamin D
   level suggest that monitoring vitamin D level should be considered in
   children.

AB Objectives. We evaluated the effects of on-street bicycle lanes
   installed prior to 2007 on different categories of crashes (total
   crashes, bicyclist crashes, pedestrian crashes, multiple-vehicle
   crashes, and injurious or fatal crashes) occurring on roadway segments
   and at intersections in New York City.
   Methods. We used generalized estimating equation methodology to compare
   changes in police-reported crashes in a treatment group and a comparison
   group before and after installation of bicycle lanes. Our study approach
   allowed us to control confounding factors, such as built environment
   characteristics, that cannot typically be controlled when a comparison
   group is used.
   Results. Installation of bicycle lanes did not lead to an increase in
   crashes, despite the probable increase in the number of bicyclists. The
   most likely explanations for the lack of increase in crashes are reduced
   vehicular speeds and fewer conflicts between vehicles and bicyclists
   after installation of these lanes.
   Conclusions. Our results indicate that characteristics of the built
   environment have a direct impact on crashes and that they should thus be
   controlled in studies evaluating traffic countermeasures such as bicycle
   lanes. To prevent crashes at intersections, we recommend installation of
   "bike boxes" and markings that indicate the path of bicycle lanes across
   intersections. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:1120-1127.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of the practice of leisure-time
   physical activity in older adults and to analyze its association with
   environment perception.
   METHODS: Cross-sectional population study conducted from September 2009
   to June 2010 with 1.656 individuals aged 60 years or older, living in
   the urban zone of the city of Floriancpolis, Southern Brazil.
   Leisure-time physical activity was measured using the long version of
   the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Environment
   perception variables were measured by means of a modified version of the
   Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale. Crude and adjusted analyzes
   were carried out using Poisson regression with a 5% significance level.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of leisure-time physical activity was 29.7% (95%
   CI: 26.0; 33.3); 35.6% (95% CI: 29.7; 41.6) among men and 26.3% (95% CI:
   23.1; 29.4) among women. The elderly who reported the existence of
   sidewalks, bike lanes, pedestrian paths and trails in the neighborhood,
   as well as those who reported receiving support from friends or
   neighbors to engage in physical activities, were more active in their
   leisure time. Concerning the influence of the climate, the elderly who
   reported that it was a barrier were rated as more active.
   CONCLUSIONS: The practice of leisure-time physical activity still has
   low prevalence among the elderly population of Floriancpolis. Public
   spaces for the practice of physical activity and encouraging group
   activities may play a significant role in the promotion of leisure-time
   physical activity in older adults.

AB Urban mobility is increasingly becoming one of the planning and
   development issues for cities in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region.
   Sub-Saharan cities are growing fast, outstripping the current transport
   infrastructure. Despite the population and spatial growth, many cities
   are defined by inadequate planning, rapid urbanisation and deteriorating
   transport infrastructure and services. In most sub-Saharan African
   countries, modes of urban mobility are highly dependent on income.
   Transport options are limited. In fact, walking and cycling are often
   the main means available for the majority of city commuters. Little
   effort is made to develop a range of transport options or to improve
   bike or walking paths. Combined with traffic jams, poor governance and
   the increasing cost of living, public transport mobility in sub-Saharan
   cities is having a tremendous impact on their liveability and citizens
   development aspirations. This paper argues that inclusive and broad
   ranging transport planning must be prioritised in SSA cities to improve
   the capacity of citizens to participate in work opportunities as well as
   to fulfil their daily domestic needs. Using observations and comparing
   progress in other countries and regions, we note that the majority urban
   poor, women in particular, are often bearing the brunt of inadequate
   planning and transport provision. We note that urban planning and
   transport infrastructure should therefore be (re) designed with
   particular focus on the wellbeing of the poor. The paper thus ends with
   a range of suggestions on what planning, design and policy options might
   be available to better integrate various commuting modes into urban
   planning infrastructure. In doing so, the paper notes that safety and
   security are critical elements of improving urban and spatial transport
   planning in the sub-Saharan Africa region. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Green space around settlements is increasingly important for recreation.
   However recreation managers have limited spatially explicit data on
   recreation potential around cities, and representative field data are
   expensive to gather. To support the identification of hot spots for
   nearby recreation we developed a GIS model based on a representative
   survey (N=1622). The model was tested for Swiss towns with
   10,000-100,000 inhabitants. Respondents indicated (1) outdoor
   activities, (2) time spent, (3) type of transportation used, (4)
   preference for given landscape properties, and (5) preferred locations
   on maps with a cell size of 1 km(2). Generalized linear models were
   applied to link people's declared presence/absence in the 1 km(2) cells
   to "objective" landscape properties of the same cells. The models
   explain 41-65% (adj. D-2) of the variance in the data. Many of the
   "objective" landscape characteristics found to significantly influence
   nearby recreation in the model match with "subjective" preferences, i.e.
   distance to residence, open water, forests, summits with overview and
   avoidance of major roads. Old people are "subjectively" more sensitive
   to landscape characteristics than young people, and indeed they visited
   locations with more distinct landscape properties. In contrast, persons
   reaching their locations by foot are "subjectively" more sensitive to
   landscape characteristics than mobile people (access by car, bicycle),
   but they go to close-by locations with less distinct landscape
   characteristics. As most people reach their locations by foot, we
   conclude that measures to improve green space should be concentrated
   within 5-10 min walking or biking distance in order to be effective. (C)

AB This paper describes the Quiet Places Project in Amsterdam. The purpose
   of the study was to find out: (1) which public quiet places there are
   according to Amsterdam residents; (2) what characterizes a quiet place;
   (3) to what extent do residents want peace and quiet; (4) how do
   residents realize these needs. The factors determining the need for
   quietness are presented in a model showing the influence of demographic
   and socio-economic issues, health status, sensitiveness to noise, daily
   activities and the noisiness in and around home. Most important of these
   factors is sensitivity to noise. Elderly and less healthy people are
   more often sensitive to noise. People who are annoyed by sound from
   traffic, airplanes and the like show a higher need for quietness. People
   with a lively household or neighbourhood report lower needs for
   quietness. Visiting a quiet place and going outside to walk or bike can
   have a compensating effect on the need for quietness. This suggests that
   creating quiet places and enhancing possibilities for quiet recreation
   in urban environments can have a positive effect on the quality of life
   in the city. Objective noise levels at the quiet places were taken from
   environmental noise maps. This shows that there may be a preference for
   low transportation noise levels, but levels up to 60 dB L-day are
   acceptable. Apparently this depends on a relative quietness or on
   non-acoustic characteristics of an area: the presence of vegetation and
   other pleasant stimuli.

AB A number of studies have been initiated to explore how to improve the
   soundscape quality in urban parks. However, good soundscape quality in
   parks cannot be provided without a thorough understanding of the complex
   relationships among sound, environment, and individuals. As acoustic
   comfort is considered to be an important outcome of soundscape quality,
   this study investigates the relative impacts of the factors influencing
   acoustic comfort evaluation by formulating a multivariate ordered logit
   model. This study also explores the inter-relationships among acoustic
   comfort evaluation, acceptability of the environment, and preference to
   stay in a park using a path model. A total of 595 valid responses were
   obtained from interview surveys administered in four parks in Hong Kong
   while objective sound measurements were carried out at the survey spots
   concurrently. The findings unveil that acoustic comfort evaluation,
   besides visual comfort evaluation of landscape, also plays an important
   role on users' acceptability of the urban park environment. Compared
   with all the studied acoustic related factors, acoustic comfort
   evaluation serves as a better proxy for park users' preference to stay
   in urban parks. Hearing the breeze will significantly increase the
   likelihood of individuals in giving high acoustic comfort evaluation.
   Conversely, hearing the sounds from heavy vehicles or sounds from bikes
   will significantly reduce the likelihood in giving a high acoustic
   evaluation. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

   examine the role of cycling facilities, we used a newly assembled
   dataset on the length of bike lanes and paths in 2008 collected directly
   from 90 of the 100 largest U.S. cities. Pearson's correlation, bivariate
   quartile analysis, and two different types of regressions were used to
   measure the relationship between cycling levels and bikeways, as well as
   other explanatory and control variables. Ordinary Least Squares and
   Binary Logit Proportions regressions confirm that cities with a greater
   supply of bike paths and lanes have significantly higher bike commute
   rates-even when controlling for land use, climate, socioeconomic
   factors, gasoline prices, public transport supply, and cycling safety.
   Standard tests indicate that the models are a good fit, with R (2)
   ranging between 0.60 and 0.65. Computed coefficients have the expected
   signs for all variables in the various regression models, but not all
   are statistically significant. Estimated elasticities indicate that both
   off-street paths and on-street lanes have a similar positive association
   with bike commute rates in U.S. cities. Our results are consistent with
   previous research on the importance of separate cycling facilities and
   provide additional information about the potentially different role of
   paths vs. lanes. Our analysis also revealed that cities with safer
   cycling, lower auto ownership, more students, less sprawl, and higher
   gasoline prices had more cycling to work. By comparison, annual
   precipitation, the number of cold and hot days, and public transport
   supply were not statistically significant predictors of bike commuting
   in large cities.

AB This paper examines parents' responses to key factors associated with
   mode choices for school trips. The research was conducted with parents
   of elementary school students in Denver Colorado as part of a larger
   investigation of school travel.
   School-based active travel programs aim to encourage students to walk or
   bike to school more frequently. To that end, planning research has
   identified an array of factors associated with parents' decisions to
   drive children to school. Many findings are interpreted as 'barriers' to
   active travel, implying that parents have similar objectives with
   respect to travel mode choices and that parents respond similarly and
   consistently to external conditions. While the conclusions are
   appropriate in forecasting demand and mode share with large populations,
   they are generally too coarse for programs that aim to influence travel
   behavior with individuals and small groups.
   This research uses content analysis of interview transcripts to examine
   the contexts of factors associated with parents' mode choices for trips
   to and from elementary school. Short, semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with 65 parents from 12 Denver Public Elementary Schools that
   had been selected to receive 2007-08 Safe Routes to School
   non-infrastructure grants. Transcripts were analyzed using Nvivo 8.0 to
   find out how parents respond to selected factors that are often
   described in planning literature as 'barriers' to active travel.
   Two contrasting themes emerged from the analysis: barrier elimination
   and barrier negotiation.
   Regular active travel appears to diminish parents' perceptions of
   barriers so that negotiation becomes second nature. Findings from this
   study suggest that intervention should build capacity and inclination in
   order to increase rates of active travel. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB E-bikes in China are the single largest adoption of alternative fuel
   vehicles in history, with more than 100 million e-bikes purchased in the
   past decade and vehicle ownership about 2X larger for e-bikes as for
   conventional cars; e-car sales, too, are rapidly growing. We compare
   emissions (CO2, PM2.5, NOx, HC) and environmental health impacts
   (primary PM2.5) from the use of conventional vehicles (CVs) and electric
   vehicles (EVs) in 34 major cities in China. CO2 emissions (g km(-1))
   vary and are an order of magnitude greater for e-cars (135-274) and CVs
   (150-180) than for e-bikes (14-27). PM2.5 emission factors generally are
   lower for CVs (gasoline or diesel) than comparable EVs. However, intake
   fraction is often greater for CVs than for EVs because combustion
   emissions are generally closer to population centers for CVs (tailpipe
   emissions) than for EVs (power plant emissions). For most cities, the
   net result is that primary PM2.5 environmental health impacts per
   passenger-km are greater for e-cars than for gasoline cars (3.6x on
   average), lower than for diesel cars (2.5X on average), and equal to
   diesel buses. In contrast, e-bikes yield lower environmental health
   impacts per passenger-km than the three CVs investigated: gasoline cars
   (2x), diesel cars (10X), and diesel buses (5x). Our findings highlight
   the importance of considering exposures, and especially the proximity of
   emissions to people, when evaluating environmental health impacts for
   EVs.

AB Introduction: Half of fatal injuries among bicyclists are head injuries.
   While helmet use is likely to provide protection, their use often
   remains rare. We assessed the influence of strategies for promotion of
   helmet use with direct observation of behaviour by a semi-automatic
   video system.
   Methods: We performed a single-centre randomised controlled study, with
   4 balanced randomisation groups. Participants were non-helmet users,
   aged 18-75 years, recruited at a loan facility in the city of Bordeaux,
   France. After completing a questionnaire investigating their attitudes
   towards road safety and helmet use, participants were randomly assigned
   to three groups with the provision of "helmet only", "helmet and
   information" or "information only", and to a fourth control group. Bikes
   were labelled with a colour code designed to enable observation of
   helmet use by participants while cycling, using a 7-spot semi-automatic
   video system located in the city. A total of 1557 participants were
   included in the study.
   Results: Between October 15th 2009 and September 28th 2010, 2621
   cyclists' movements, made by 587 participants, were captured by the
   video system. Participants seen at least once with a helmet amounted to
   6.6% of all observed participants, with higher rates in the two groups
   that received a helmet at baseline. The likelihood of observed helmet
   use was significantly increased among participants of the "helmet only"
   group (OR = 7.73 [2.09-28.5]) and this impact faded within six months
   following the intervention. No effect of information delivery was found.
   Conclusion: Providing a helmet may be of value, but will not be
   sufficient to achieve high rates of helmet wearing among adult cyclists.
   Integrated and repeated prevention programmes will be needed, including
   free provision of helmets, but also information on the protective effect
   of helmets and strategies to increase peer and parental pressure.

   existing capacities, findings of user satisfaction surveys, impacts of
   bike-sharing introduction on modal split and on the emissions of
   pollutants. The second part of the paper presents the effects of
   introducing the first phase of BS system to Novi Sad which is a part of
   a broader scheme termed "Let's return Novi Sad back to cyclists." It
   also presents basic features of Novi Sad traffic system development over
   the past thirty years, with particular attention to bicycle traffic
   development. The goal of these analyses was to highlight the importance
   of introducing new traffic policy measures to reduce car use and expand
   the use of environmentally friendly modes of transport. BS scheme is one
   of the measures to address Novi Sad's traffic issues and it requires
   continuous follow-up: monitoring usage, implementing corrective measures
   and improving the system.

AB Constrained and congested streets hinder accelerated transit service and
   the provision of protected space for cycling. Although bus rapid transit
   has proved effective at improving transit service in cities, the
   addition of a physical priority for transit must be balanced against
   competing needs for traffic flow and parking, particularly in areas with
   high levels of activity. On October 10, 2010, the New York City Transit
   Authority of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority-now known as MTA
   New York City Transit-and the New York City Department of Transportation
   implemented the M15 select bus service on First and Second Avenues. This
   bus rapid transit service generated a significant improvement to transit
   service in a constrained corridor and created space for safe bicycling
   facilities and pedestrian safety improvements, and all general traffic
   flow along the corridor was maintained. The M15 select bus service
   improved bus speed and reliability with proof-of-payment fare
   collection, new bus lanes, and improved bus lane treatments, including
   offset bus lanes (next to the parking lane). Passenger comfort and
   reliability were also enhanced through route simplification, improved
   scheduling, enhanced stations, and better customer information. The
   results have been noteworthy, with a 15% to 18% improvement in travel
   time and a 10% increase in corridor ridership. Cycling has also
   increased substantially along the corridor, on which new
   parking-protected bike lanes were installed as part of the project.
   These gains were achieved through close coordination with all corridor
   stakeholders, careful use of priority treatments on parts of the
   corridor, and the close working partnership between the New York City
   Department of Transportation and MTA New York City Transit.

AB Existing research into cycling behaviours has either relied on detailed

   following recent contributions from information visualization [13] and
   data mining [5] [7], this design study uses visual analytics techniques
   to identify, describe and explain cycling behaviours within a large and
   attribute rich transactional dataset. Using data from London's bike
   share scheme(1), customer level classifications will be created, which
   consider the regularity of scheme use, journey length and travel times.
   Monitoring customer usage over time, user classifications will attend to
   the dynamics of cycling behaviour, asking substantive questions about
   how behaviours change under varying conditions. The 3-year PhD project
   will contribute to academic and strategic discussions around sustainable
   travel policy. A programme of research is outlined, along with an early
   visual analytics prototype for rapidly querying customer journeys.

AB This paper concerns how claims to public space are negotiated between
   differently embodied subjects, and how forms of bodily articulation
   shape capacities for sharing space. Drawing on a study of outdoor access
   practices, entailing mobile video ethnographies with walkers and
   cyclists, it explores the corporeal mechanisms through which the
   entitlements of differentlymobile subjects are asserted, resisted,
   circumscribed or accepted in the time-spaces of bodily encounter. How
   the signalling of 'responsible' and 'irresponsible' conduct influences
   how bodies are allowed to move in relation to other bodies is the focus.
   Mobilisations of speed, affective and sensory attunement, and techniques
   of bodily articulation, were found to be a key in the disciplining of
   cycling and walking bodies. This paper highlights the central role of
   attunement to, and concession of, hybrid subjectivity in the
   choreography of encounters, and, moreover, how related burdens of
   orchestrating coexistence are shared and struggled over amongst
   different publics. It demonstrates that whilst greater attunement can
   enable differently mobile subjects to develop a reciprocal choreography,
   expectations of such attunement can also undermine the ability to share
   space if not met. This paper thus raises the dilemma of when to accept
   or extend the limits of attunement in facilitating coexistence in public
   space.

AB A crucial issue in bike-sharing systems (BSS) is the unbalanced
   distribution in space and time of the bikes among the stations.
   Literature shows several methods, to solve the vehicle reallocation
   problem and most of them are based on rigid control thresholds and refer
   to car-sharing systems. In this paper a more flexible fuzzy decision
   support system for redistribution process in BSS is presented. The aim
   of the proposed method is to minimize the redistribution costs for
   bike-sharing companies, determining the optimal bikes repositioning
   flows, distribution patterns and time intervals between relocation
   operations, with the objective of a high level for users satisfaction.
   The proposed method allows to define the best bikes repositioning
   jointly to the best route for the carrier vehicles. The optimization
   method has been applied to a simulated BSS that can be considered as a
   module of a wider real BSS thanks to the scalable architecture of the
   decision support system. The results of this first tests are interesting
   even if further investigation are in progress. (C) 2012 Published by

AB This paper presents a before-after study of bike boxes at 10 signalized
   intersections in Portland, Oregon. The bike boxes, also known as
   advanced stop lines or advanced stop boxes, were installed to increase
   visibility of cyclists and reduce conflicts between motor vehicles and
   cyclists, particularly in potential "right-hook" situations. Before and
   after video were analyzed for seven intersections with green bike boxes,
   three intersections with uncolored bike boxes, and two control
   intersections. User perceptions were measured through surveys of
   cyclists passing through five of the bike box intersections and of
   motorists working downtown, where the boxes were concentrated. Both the
   observations and survey of motorists found a high rate of compliance and
   understanding of the markings. Overall, 73% of the stopping motor
   vehicles did not encroach at all into the bike box. Both motor vehicle
   and bicycle encroachment in the pedestrian crosswalk fell significantly
   at the bike box locations compared to the control intersections. The
   bike boxes had mixed effects on the motorists' encroachment in the
   bicycle lane. The number of observed conflicts at the bike box locations
   decreased, while the total number of cyclists and motor vehicles turning
   right increased. Negative-binomial models based upon the data predict
   fewer conflicts with the boxes, particularly as right-turning motor
   vehicle volumes increase. Observations of yielding behavior at two bike
   box and one control intersection found an improvement in motorists
   yielding to cyclists at the bike box locations. Differences in the
   traffic volumes and location contexts make firm conclusions about the
   effects of green coloring of the boxes difficult. Higher shares of
   surveyed motorists felt that the bike boxes made driving safer rather
   than more dangerous, even when the sample was narrowed to respondents
   who were not also cyclists. Over three-quarters of the surveyed cyclists
   thought that the boxes made the intersection safer. (C) 2010 Elsevier

AB This paper employs the Ivaldi-Vibes algorithm to model the U.S. fuel
   market under the hypothetical scenario in which the ethanol production
   subsidies were phased out from 1995- 2005. Under this hypothetical
   situation, the individuals were not only willing to switch their
   consumption decision, but they were also willing to consider alternative
   modes of transportation including public transportation, biking or
   walking. As a result, the outside alternative market share increased
   about 4% and 6% and the conventional fuel market shares increased while
   the ethanol blends experienced decreases across all petroleum
   districts.This methodology also permitted simulating the impact of this
   elimination on the fuel prices. The conventional fuel prices increased
   in a range between 0.12 and 1.34 percent. Finally, since different types
   of oxygenates are blended with the regular fuel to compliance the EPA
   regulations, the reduction in the reformulated gasoline market shares
   implied a trade off in the demand for these oxygenates whose variation

   los subsidios a la production de etanol fueron eliminados desde 1995
   hasta 2005. En esta situation hipotetica, los individuos no solo estaban
   dispuestos a cambiar su decision de consumo, sino tambien a considerar
   modos alternativos de transporte, incluyendo el transporte publico, en
   bicicleta o caminar. Como resultado, la cuota de mercado exterior
   alternativa aumento un 4% y 6% y las cuotas del mercado de combustibles
   convencionales aumento, mientras que el etanol combinado experimento
   disminuciones en todos los distritos petroleros. Esta metodologia
   tambien permite simular el impacto de esta elimination en los precios de
   los combustibles. Los precios de los combustibles convencionales
   aumentaron en un rango entre 0,12 y 1,34 por ciento. Por ultimo, ya que
   los diferentes tipos de compuestos oxigenados son combinados con la
   gasolina regular para el cumplimiento de las regulaciones de la EPA, la
   reduccion de las cuotas de mercado de combustibles reformulados implica
   un trade-off de la demanda de estos productos oxigenados, cuya tasa de
   variacion promedio es de 55,14% para la razon etanol- MTBE.

AB Objective: Our objective was to describe current patterns of bicycle
   helmet usage in a university community using a direct observation
   approach.
   Participants: Cyclists in a university community observed in 2010 and
   2011.
   Methods: We identified 6 locations in Athens, Georgia, and recorded the
   type of bicycle, age group, sex, and helmet usage of passing cyclists.
   We performed univariate and multivariate analysis to identify
   independent predictors of helmet usage.
   Results: We observed 433 cyclists: 74 percent male, 74 percent college
   age, and 45 percent of whom wore a helmet. Helmet usage varied by
   bicycle type, location of observation, and age group. Independent
   predictors of bike helmet were on-campus location (0.38, 95% confidence
   interval [CI]: 0.22-0.66), college-age rider (0.29, 95% CI: 0.15-0.54),
   and use of a city or leisure bike (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23-0.65).
   Conclusions: College-age riders, riders on campus, and those riding a
   city or leisure-style bike are less likely to wear a helmet. Health
   promotion efforts aimed at increasing helmet usage should target these
   groups.

AB People's perceptions about the appropriate location of mobility centers
   are modeled. A case study for the Municipality of Kalamaria in
   Thessaloniki, Greece, is presented. The results of a stated preference
   survey, which revealed residents' perceptions about the optimal
   locations for these centers, as well as the spatial and other
   characteristics of the region, were used as inputs. Models were then
   developed and estimated: a linear regression model, a spatial
   simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model, and a geographically weighted
   regression (GWR) model. The exploratory analysis used the respondents'
   perception of optimal location as the response variable, and the
   explanatory variables are information about the population; points of
   interest; bus routes; average income; road network (i.e., length, number
   of lanes, and average speeds); and distances from stadium, pedestrian
   shopping zone, and paid parking facility. Results indicated that the
   selection of the appropriate location for a mobility center was
   influenced primarily by number of residents, number of points of
   interest, number of bus routes, average vehicle speed, and length of the
   road network. The GWR model seemed to fit the data best, whereas Moran's
   I-test showed that the model solved the autocorrelation of the
   residuals, something that the other models [ordinary least squares (OLS)
   and SARmix] fail to accomplish. The model's predicted values were
   localized (unlike OLS) and made the decision easier. The proposed method
   is generic (not system dependent) and can be applied to different
   optimal location selection schemes, especially those with similar demand
   characteristics (e.g., for automobile- or bike-sharing stations).

AB Recently, the introduction of dense, long-range 3D sensors has
   facilitated tracking of arbitrary objects. Especially in the context of
   autonomous driving, other traffic participants driving the streets
   usually stay well-segmented from each other. In contrast, pedestrians or
   bicyclists do not always stay on the road and they often get close to
   static structure of the environment, e.g. traffic lights or signs,
   bushes, parking cars etc. These objects are not as easy to segment,
   often resulting in an under-segmentation of the scene and wrong tracking
   results. This paper addresses the problem of tracking moving objects
   that are hard to segment from their static surroundings by utilizing
   top-down knowledge about the geometry of existing tracks during
   segmentation. This includes methods for discerning static from moving
   objects to reduce the rate of false positive tracks as well as a
   classification of tracks into pedestrian, bicyclist, motor bike,
   passenger car, van and truck classes by considering an objects
   appearance and motion history. The proposed tracking system is
   experimentally validated in challenging real-world inner-city traffic
   scenes.

AB Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate components within
   safety, amenity, information, convenience and amusement among 198
   participants who joined to Gyeongju historic sites tour by bike. As
   results of a SEM, the component of amusement primarily affects the
   degree of satisfaction (DS) (0.61). Second significant component
   influencing the DS is the convenience (0.22) followed by safety (0.16)
   and information (0.07). Four variables denoting the amusement component
   are as follows: "Playing in rest time (e.g., game)" (0.82), "How about
   course? Not detour?" (0.81), "Human relationship among team members"
   (0.76). This means that participants consider amusement as the most
   important factor. Second important component is the convenience. It
   consists of such variables as "Fee - expensive or cheap" (0.88), "Easy
   to resister for participant" (0.75) and "Quality of rental bike" (0.47).
   For the component of safety, participants of Gyeongju Bike Tour Program
   (GBTP) put little importance since they recognized the program itself to
   be safely run. In this paper, we suggest that the local government needs
   to play a core role in improving the bike infrastructure such "Safety of
   shared bike road" and "Obstructions on bike road", although an amusement
   is the most important component for improving the program running.

AB The paper deals with the use of bicycle messengers, also called bike
   couriers, in the modern logistics chain. In an era where almost every
   actor - from policy makers to senior managers - is thinking about the
   environment and sustainability, new innovative concepts are developed
   worldwide. On the other hand, an abundance of solutions to improve
   efficiency and overall sustainability of logistics and other related
   business activities are already available in the market. Reinventing the
   wheel all over again might not be necessary. One of the methods to
   deliver parcels in a more sustainable way, is the transport of freight
   by bike. People on bike deliver and transport post, parcels or freight
   with a low volume or weight. Bike couriers are proven to be fast and
   reliable within congested urban areas. These bikers mainly advertised
   their ability to go fast from one place to another in a city.
   Sustainability was a selling argument, but speed was of more importance.
   Also, in Europe some bike courier markets are reasonably well developed.
   Specific markets seem to exist for transport of freight by bike.
   The research question of this paper concerning bicycle messengers is
   whether these companies can be an economic viable alternative for fossil
   fuel powered transport, and if so, in what markets these opportunities
   can be found. The authors draw conclusions about the business model and
   integrate encountered weaknesses and opportunities. An operational cost
   calculation is included. A simulation of a round trip delivery scheme in
   an urban area took place. A van as well as a bike courier solution was
   compared. To draw some conclusions about the economic feasibility of the
   round trip by bike courier, the cost per stop is compared and will be
   discussed.
   The paper ends with a conclusion on the observations made, and with a
   number of recommendations. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection

   for real time information in urban transportation. RMob provides fast,
   reliable and clear information about transportation in Rome, e.g. bus
   arrival times, urban travel times, bus stop maps, etc. People moving in
   large urban areas need to predict travel times and choose the fastest
   routes; they generally take real time decisions without planning ahead
   and are usually in hurry so they have limited time for interaction with
   the device and the application. This work aims to providing travellers
   in the urban Rome area with timely and accurate information, minimizing
   the interaction and the text input, so encouraging the best travel
   choice and the use of public transportation. Based on the di.erent
   travel phases described in the literature, we propose a distinction on
   the nearby resources (bus stops, bus arrival times, parkings, car/bike
   sharing stations, etc.) and trip-destination resources (routes, travel
   times, parkings and stations at destination, etc.). The application was
   designed using this model that seems appropriate and usable according to
   our observations. RMob is published online for iOS and Android devices.

AB Strategic partnership is a logical approach to face some of the public
   health problems. However, its application is somewhat more complex. In
   this paper our experience with three networks (Agita Sao Paulo, Physical
   Activity Network of Americas, and Agita Mundo Network) was described. In
   the case of Agita Sao Paulo even the name was a consequence of a
   partnership with a marketing company, and is an idiomatic expression
   that means much more than just to move your body. It also means to move
   psychologically and socially, with the concept of "active citizenship".
   Among the important features of that intervention, we highlighted: (a)
   national and international intellectual partnership; (b) strong
   institutional partnerships, including government in one hand, and
   non-governmental and private sector in the other hand, in a so called:
   "two-hats approach"; (c) minimal formalization/maximal flexibility; (d)
   a signed letter of agreement: an active symbol of institutional
   commitment; (e) use the "mobile management" adaptation of the ecological
   model, in which attention was given to intrapersonal, social, and
   physical environmental factors, in a dynamic way; (f) attention to
   inter-sectoral as well as to intra-sectoral partners, in which creates
   incentives for participation of more than one representative from each
   sector; (g) the inclusion principle, that was not restricted to the
   institution, but affected the program actions, materials, and
   particularly the messages; (h) a high level of legitimacy of the
   coordination institution in the leadership; (i) special attention to
   improve environment supports for physical activity, such as: strategic
   partnerships established with the Metro System, that serves over I
   million persons/day; the Truck Drivers Radio Station; the State
   Secretariat of Environment, that built a walking path around its main
   building; the city of Sao Caetano do Sul, with the healthy sidewalk
   program: the city of Santana do Parnaiba building a walking path around
   the outpatients clinic, as well as the establishment of a fitness room
   in the basic unit of health; and Sorocaba, a city of 600,000
   inhabitants, that after 4 years of the program of building walk and bike
   pathways, and parks, found a decrease in hospitalization of 50% by
   stroke, and 57% of diabetes type 2. A recent paper has shown that
   sedendarism has declined relatively about 70% from 2002 to 2008 in the
   State of Sao Paulo, and World Bank has reported that Agita represents a
   saving of 310 million US dollars per year in the health sector of Sao
   Paulo. All this scenario strongly suggests that the social issue in the
   developing countries facilitates the success of strategic partnerships.

AB In the early fall of 2009, the Bureau of Transportation in Portland,
   Oregon, installed a cycle track and a pair of buffered bike lanes in
   downtown Portland. A major objective was to test facilities that were
   thought to bring higher levels of comfort to bicycle riders through
   increased separation from motor vehicle traffic. After one year of use,
   an evaluation was conducted to determine how the facilities affected the
   experience of the various users. Intercept surveys of cyclists (n =
   248), motorists (n = 262), pedestrians (n = 198), and adjacent
   businesses (n = 59) showed improved perceptions of safety and comfort
   among cyclists, particularly women. Cyclists also preferred the new
   facilities to alternative routes and facility types. Both motorists and
   cyclists liked the additional separation of users. Motorists were more
   likely to attribute additional travel delays and inconvenience to the
   facilities; this attitude was especially true for motorists who never
   rode a bicycle and those surveyed on the buffered bike lane facility.
   Pedestrians liked the increased separation from traffic but had concerns
   about interactions with cyclists when crossing the cycle track.
   Businesses expressed support for these and other new bicycle facilities
   but had concerns about parking and deliveries.

   issue is change of the people's mobility behaviours towards more
   sustainable transport means: public transport, bikes, walking trips or
   shared car usage - carpooling and carsharing systems. Travelers'
   attitudes and behaviours can be shaped by using the mobility management
   concept. Mobility management is an approach to the passenger transport,
   oriented on promotion of the sustainable mobility modes and on the
   management of the demand for car usage. Change of the mobility attitudes
   and behaviours is very long and not easy process, thus mobility
   management includes many instruments and strategies such as:
   legislative, infrastructure, financial, land use related instruments as
   well as strategies related to informational, educational and promotional

AB Incentives are effective tools when people should be encouraged to
   change their behavior. This is also true for travel behavior. Adopted
   from the incentive system that was included in the flexible mechanism of
   the Kyoto protocol for pollutant emissions based on "green
   certificates", the Mobility Credit system in Bologna rewards people for
   sustainable travel behavior. Going by bike, public transport or using
   car sharing/pooling instead of taking the private car will be rewarded
   with a complementary amount of mobility eco savings (mobility credits).
   These credits can be used to get environmental/energy benefits such as a
   free bus ticket. This incentive system should help to convince people to
   consider alternatives to the private car and start to develop their mind
   set towards more multimodal thinking.
   The measure so-called "MobiMart" is conducted as a pilot test within
   CIVITAS MIMOSA, a European project co-funded by EC. It aims at
   designing, prototyping and demonstrating a model for measure mobility
   eco-savings coming from different instruments, both at citizen and
   community level. The challenge is to implement a widely acceptable
   certification method for mileage savings, resource use, emissions
   reduction, etc. Conversion criteria and trading rules, validated
   protocols and guidelines about mobility credits issuing and voluntary
   agreements between key stakeholders for mutual recognition of transport
   related mobility credits will be implemented. The results will
   contribute to the understanding of successful promotion of multimodal
   travel behavior.

   results from the pilot test implementations in Bologna and an outline of
   the evaluation framework. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection

AB This article presents a methodology to simultaneously modelize private
   car and public bicycle transport modes, considering their interactions
   through the modeling of the modal split and the assignment of each
   mode's trips to the network. Then the model is used to optimize the
   location of docking stations in a public sharing bicycle system, to
   achieve a transport system as efficient and sustainable as economically
   and socially possible. To model the car-bike system, it was necessary to
   perform a user behavior analysis, emphasizing the characterization of
   the potential bicycle user. Our objectives were: to discern which
   variables does the user take into account to choose, in an urban
   environment, between public bicycle and car; and to modelize bicycle
   users' route choice. The proposed methodology is divided into three
   parts. In the first one, a transport network was created, over which car
   and bicycle users can be simulated at the same time. The second part is
   a type of combined modal split-assignment model, with its input coming
   from a global matrix (car and bicycle trips). A Multinomial Logit model
   for modal split and network assignment models will follow an iterative
   process to provide the final OD matrices and service variables for each
   mode of transport. After the definition and validation of the multimodal
   model, the third part, an optimization model, has been developed, based
   on bi-level mathematical programming. The objective is to optimize the
   location of a system of public bicycle docking stations. A combination
   of the different optimization criteria and problem reduction strategies
   has been applied to the real scenario of Santander city (Spain). It has
   been possible to perform a comparative analysis of the current
   situation, versus the model's proposal, getting results helpful to the
   relevant decision-making entities. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In most Chinese cities, electric bicycles and electrically assisted
   bicycles (e-bikes) have drastically increased in recent years and
   currently constitute the largest proportion of the nonmotorized traffic
   at signalized intersections. Proper treatment of e-bikes has become a
   vitally important issue in improving the operational efficiency and
   safety performance of signalized intersections. However, fundamental
   knowledge of the unique operating characteristics and behavior of riders
   of e-bikes under various conditions is insufficient. This study
   statistically analyzed critical behavioral parameters of e-bike riders
   and empirically modeled their start-up behavior at the green onset
   following a 3-s red-and-yellow signal and their stop-pass decision
   behavior at the yellow onset following a 3-s flashing green.
   Distribution types and parameters of desired speed, start-up time,
   acceleration rate, perception-reaction time, and deceleration rate were
   investigated with the use of highly accurate trajectory data. A
   temporal-spatial model was developed to interpret the start-up curve,
   and three binary logistic regression models were built to predict the
   stop-pass decisions for different rider groups. It was found that the
   start-up curve of e-bikes could be well described by a quadratic
   function and that the red-and-yellow signal significantly induced a
   hurried start. The potential time to the stop line at the decision point
   was found to be the dominant independent factor explaining the stop-pass
   decision of e-bike riders; the flashing green signal seemed to enlarge
   the option zone, bring the indecision zone earlier, and result in more
   aggressive passing behavior.

AB Both the UN (2007) and World Health Organizations (2004) have declared
   the enormous social and economic burden imposed on society by injuries
   due to road collisions as a major global problem. While the road safety
   problem is not new, this prominent global declaration sends an important
   signal of frustration regarding progress to date on reducing road
   collisions. It is clear that governments, communities, businesses and
   the public must discover ways of reducing this burden, especially as it
   relates to vulnerable road users (VRUs), typically meaning pedestrian
   and bicyclist road users. Recent comparisons of global VRU collisions
   statistics suggest that, in addition to mixed land use density, the
   layout of neighbourhood roads plays a vital role in the encouragement of
   walkable, safe and quiet, yet accessible and sustainable communities.
   The purpose of this paper was to:
   (1) Review the literature concerning sustainable neighbourhood land use
   and transportation network patterns, increased VRU volumes, and road
   safety;
   (2) Present empirical research results on road safety related to VRU
   volumes; and
   (3) Present emerging research regarding more sustainable land use and
   transportation patterns, increased VRU volumes, and road safety.
   The Dutch Sustainable Road Safety (SRS) Program has produced a number of
   innovative land use and transportation initiatives for vehicular road
   users as well as non-vehicular VRUs. Following from the Dutch
   initiatives, these new 3-way offset, and fused grid neighbourhood
   patterns appear to not only have positive effects in encouraging mode
   split (i.e. increasing walking and bicycling, and transit), slowing
   traffic, and reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions; but also, to
   hold potential to improve road safety.
   To test the road safety hypothesis, UBCO researchers evaluated the level
   of road safety relative to five neighbourhood patterns - grid,
   culs-de-sac, and Dutch Sustainable Road Safety (SRS) (or limited
   access), 3-way offset, and fused grid networks. Analysis using standard
   transportation planning methodology revealed that they would maintain
   both mobility and accessibility. Analysis using standard road safety
   analysis methodology further revealed that these 3-way offset, and fused
   grid patterns would significantly improve road safety levels by as much
   as 60% compared to prevalent patterns (i.e. grid and culs-de-sac).
   It is important to note that these results ignore the road safety
   effects of providing convenient off-road trails along trip desire lines
   to shift mode choice from auto to non-auto VRU modes. Subject to further
   research, it is intuitive that shifting trips from auto to
   pedestrian/bike modes will lead to reduced auto collisions. Hence, these
   initial results should be considered as conservative estimates, subject
   to further research. In before and after studies to date, researchers
   have shown that increasing bicycle use does not lead to a commensurate
   increase in bicycle collisions, but no predictive relationship has been
   found in the literature. Therefore, the next steps in this research are
   to develop collision prediction models that provide insight on VRU mode
   split and overall road safety. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB OBJECTIVE: Safety concerns deter cycling. The Bicyclists' Injuries and
   the Cycling Environment (BICE) study quantified the injury risk
   associated with 14 route types, from off-road paths to major streets.
   However, when it comes to injury risk, there may be discordance between
   empirical evidence and perceptions. If so, even if protective
   infrastructure is built people may not feel safe enough to cycle. This
   paper reports on the relationship between perceived and observed injury
   risk.
   METHODS: The BICE study is a case-crossover study that recruited 690
   injured adult cyclists who visited emergency departments in Toronto and
   Vancouver. Observed risk was calculated by comparing route types at the
   injury sites with those at randomly selected control sites along the
   same route. The perceived risk was the mean response of study
   participants to the question "How safe do you think this site was for
   cyclists on that trip?", with responses scored from +1 (very safe) to -1
   (very dangerous). Perceived risk scores were only calculated for
   non-injury control sites, to reduce bias by the injury event.
   RESULTS: The route type with the greatest perceived risk was major
   streets with shared lanes and no parked cars (mean score = -0.21, 95%
   confidence interval [CI]: -0.54-0.11), followed by major streets without
   bicycle infrastructure (-0.07, CI -0.14-0.00). The safest perceived
   routes were paved multi-use paths (0.66, CI 0.43-0.89), residential
   streets (0.44, CI 0.37-0.51), bike paths (0.42, CI 0.25-0.60) and
   residential streets marked as bike routes with traffic calming (0.41, CI
   0.32-0.51). Most route types that were perceived as higher risk were
   found to be so in our injury study; similarly, most route types
   perceived as safer were also found to be so. Discrepancies were observed
   for cycle tracks (perceived as less safe than observed) and for multiuse
   paths (perceived as safer than observed).
   CONCLUSIONS: Route choices and decisions to cycle are affected by
   perceptions of safety, and we found that perceptions usually
   corresponded with observed safety. However, perceptions about certain
   separated route types did not align well. Education programs and social
   media may be ways to ensure that public perceptions of route safety
   reflect the evidence.

   System. Now, the System has been the largest bike- sharing program in
   the world. The software of Hangzhou Public Bicycle System was developed
   by our team. There are many and many technology problems in the decision
   of intelligent dispatch. Among of these problems, determining how to
   find the key stations to give special care is very important. In this
   paper, an improved k-means algorithm is used to recognize the key
   stations of Hangzhou Public Bicycle System. At first, by passing over
   the two week's real data, a rent-return database is initialed. Then the
   algorithm builds minimum spanning tree and splits it to gets k initial
   cluster centers. The key stations are determined from the rent-return
   database by the algorithm. Practice examples and comparison with the
   traditional k-means algorithm are made. The results show that the
   proposed algorithm is efficient and robust. The research result has been
   applied in Hangzhou.

AB The use of electric bikes (e-bikes) in China has grown tremendously in
   the past decade. Traffic safety for e-bike riders is an issue of growing
   public concern because the number of fatalities and injuries is
   increasing. A study was conducted to identify risk factors affecting
   involvement of e-bike riders in accidents and to establish the
   relationships between safety attitudes, risk perception, and aberrant
   riding behaviors. The data used for analysis were obtained from a
   self-reported questionnaire survey of a sample of 603 e-bike riders in
   two large cities in China. The results showed that both gender and
   automobile driving experience were significantly associated with
   at-fault accident involvement. Males were more likely to have at-fault
   accidents than were females, and riders with an automobile driver's
   license were less likely to have accidents than were those without a
   driver's license. Two types of aberrant riding behaviors, errors and
   aggressive behaviors, were found to be significant factors for
   predicting at-fault accident involvement. Analysis with a structural
   equation model indicated that safety attitudes and risk perception both
   significantly affected aberrant riding behaviors. E-bike riders with
   stronger positive attitudes toward safety and more worry and concern
   about their traffic risk tended to be less likely to have aberrant
   riding behaviors. Practical implications for improving road safety of
   e-bike riders are discussed.

AB Cycling is attracting renewed attention as a mode of transport in
   western urban environments, yet the determinants of usage are poorly
   understood. In this paper we investigate some of these using intraday
   bicycle volumes collected via induction loops located at ten bike paths
   in the city of Melbourne, Australia, between December 2005 and June
   2008. The data are hourly counts at each location, with temporal and
   spatial disaggregation allowing for the impact of meteorology to be
   measured accurately for the first time. Moreover, during this period
   petrol prices varied dramatically and the data also provide a unique
   opportunity to assess the cross-price elasticity of demand for cycling.
   Over-dispersed Poisson regression models are used to model volumes at
   each location and at each hour of the day. Seasonality and the impact of
   weather conditions are modelled as semiparametric and estimated using
   recently developed multivariate penalized spline methodology. Unlike
   previous studies that use aggregate data, the empirical results show a
   substantial meteorological and seasonal component to usage. They also
   suggest there was substitution into cycling as a mode of transport in
   response to increases in petrol prices, particularly during peak
   commuting periods and by commuters originating in wealthy and inner city
   neighbourhoods. Last, we extend the approach to a multivariate
   longitudinal count data model using a Gaussian copula estimated by
   Bayesian data augmentation. We find first order serial dependence in the
   hourly volumes and a 'return trip' effect in daily bicycle commutes. (C)

   Electrically assisted bicycles (EAB) are an emerging transportation
   modality favored for environmental reasons. Some physical effort is
   required to activate the supporting engine, making it a potential active
   commuting option. Purpose: We hypothesized that using an EAB in a hilly
   city allows sedentary subjects to commute comfortably, while providing a
   sufficient effort for health-enhancing purposes. Methods: Sedentary
   subjects performed four different trips at a self-selected pace: walking
   1.7 km uphill from the train station to the hospital (WALK), biking 5.1
   km from the lower part of town to the hospital with a regular bike
   (BIKE), or EAB at two different power assistance settings (EAB(high),
   EAB(std)). HR, oxygen consumption, and need to shower were recorded.
   Results: Eighteen sedentary subjects (12 female, 6 male) age 36 +/- 10
   yr were included, with (V) over dotO(2max) of 39.4 +/- 5.4
   mL.min(-1).kg(-1). Time to complete the course was 22 (WALK), 19
   (EAB(high)), 21 (EAB(std)), and 30 (BIKE) min. Mean %(V) over dotO(2max)
   was 59.0%, 54.9%, 65.7%, and 72.8%. Mean%HRmax was 71.5%, 74.5%, 80.3%,
   and 84.0%. There was no significant difference between WALK and
   EAB(high), but all other comparisons were different (P < 0.05). Two
   subjects needed to shower after EAB(high), 3 needed to shower after
   WALK, 8 needed to shower after EAB(std), and all 18 needed to shower
   after BIKE. WALK and EAB(high) elicited 6.5 and 6.1 METs (no
   difference), whereas it was 7.3 and 8.2 for EAB(std) and BIKE.
   Conclusions: EAB is a comfortable and ecological transportation
   modality, helping sedentary people commute to work and meet physical
   activity guidelines. Subjects appreciated ease of use and mild effort
   needed to activate the engine support climbing hills, without the need
   to shower at work. EAB can be promoted in a challenging urban
   environment to promote physical activity and mitigate pollution issues.

AB We present an agent-based model of bicycle racing that incorporates both
   physiology and the types of multiplayer scenarios that arise in real
   races. In these scenarios, riders can choose to share the workload with
   other riders (cooperate) or pursue their own self-interests (defect). We
   compare the model's predictions to race situations and use it to
   investigate how different strategies can affect outcomes. We find that
   an individual player's best strategy depends on fitness level:
   below-average riders fare better as defectors whereas above-average
   riders perform better as cooperators. The strategies of stronger riders
   affect their teammates' results as well. The teammates of defecting
   strong riders fare worse overall than the teammates of cooperating
   strong riders. These results reproduce a dynamic that played out in the
   2009 Tour de France. The winner, Alberto Contador, pursued a strategy
   perceived by many to be unusually uncooperative by repeatedly defecting
   on his teammates. The strategy worked to his advantage but may have
   negatively affected his teammates' placements. (c) 2011 Wiley

AB By July 2011, North American carsharing had grown to an industry of
   nearly 640,000 members since its inception on the continent more than 15
   years ago. Carsharing engenders changes in member travel patterns both
   towards and away from public transit and non-motorized modes. This
   study, which builds on the work of two previous studies, evaluates this
   shift in travel based on a 6281 respondent survey completed in late-2008
   by members of major North American carsharing organizations. Across the
   entire sample, the results showed an overall decline in public transit
   use that was statistically significant, as 589 carsharing members
   reduced rail use and 828 reduced bus use, while 494 increased rail use
   and 732 increased bus use. Thus for every five members that use rail
   less, four members use rail more, and for every 10 members that ride a
   bus less, almost nine members ride the bus more. The people increasing
   and decreasing their transit use are fundamentally different in terms of
   how carsharing impacts their travel environment. This reduction,
   however, is also not uniform across all organizations; it is primarily
   driven by a minority (three of eleven) of participating organizations.
   At the same time, members exhibited a statistically significant increase
   in travel by walking, bicycling, and carpooling. Across the sample, 756
   members increased walking versus a 568 decrease, 628 increased bicycling
   versus a 235 decrease, and 289 increased carpooling versus a decrease of
   99 study participants. The authors found that 970 members reduced their
   auto commuting to work, while 234 increased it. Interestingly, when
   these shifts are combined across modes, more people increased their
   overall public transit and non-motorized modal use after joining
   carsharing than decreased it. Data collected on the commute distance of
   respondents found that carsharing members tend to have shorter commutes
   than most people living in the same zip code. The analysis also
   evaluates the distribution of residential population density of members
   and its association with average changes in driving. The analysis finds
   that average driving reductions are consistent across population
   densities up to 10,000 persons/square kilometer but become more varied
   at higher densities.

AB Within the competitive market environment, understanding customer
   requirements is crucial for all corporations to obtain market share and
   survive competition. Only the products exactly meeting customer
   requirements can win in the market place. Therefore, customer
   requirements play a very important role in the evaluation and decision
   process of conceptual design schemes of products. In this paper, an
   evaluation and decision method based on customer requirements is
   presented. It utilizes the importance of customer requirements, the
   satisfaction degree of each evaluation metric to the specification, and
   an evaluation metric which models customer requirements to evaluate the
   satisfaction degree of each design scheme to specific customer
   requirements via the proposed BP neural networks. In the evaluation and
   decision process, fuzzy sets are used to describe the importance of
   customer requirements, the relationship between customer requirements
   and evaluation metrics, the satisfaction degree of each scheme to

AB This paper extends research on urban form and travel behavior beyond
   adult travel by examining teen travelers aged 13-19 in the Greater
   Toronto Area. Data from the Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) survey
   are used to study four main research questions: (1) How has teen mode
   choice changed from 1986 to 2006? (2) How do these choices vary as teens
   transition from the 13-15 age group to being of driving age (16-19)? (3)
   How do these choices vary across the different urban and suburban
   regions of the GTA? (4) What are some of the differences between teen
   travel and adult travel? Results show that in general, active
   transportation has decreased, while auto-passenger mode shares have
   increased across the region. The younger group walks more and the older
   group takes transit more for both school and discretionary travel.
   Jurisdictions with better transit supply and orientation have higher
   transit mode shares for school trips, but discretionary trips have very
   low transit mode shares. Walk mode shares for both school and
   discretionary travel are similar across all jurisdictions, regardless of
   whether they are urban or suburban. In contrast to adult travel in the
   GTA, built form characteristics and transit supply do not appear to have
   a direct relationship with teen mode choice. Urban form appears to exert
   an indirect influence on teen travel. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Background: The White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity has set a
   goal of increasing walking and biking to school by 50% within 5 years.
   Meeting the goal requires a detailed understanding of the current
   patterns of school travel.
   Purpose: To document nationally representative estimates of the amount
   of school travel and the modes used to access school in 2009 and compare
   these levels with 1969, 1995, and 2001.
   Methods: The National Household Travel Survey collected data on the
   travel patterns of 150,147 households in 2008 and 2009. Analyses,
   conducted in 2010, documented the time, vehicle miles traveled, and
   modes used by American students to reach school. A binary logit model
   assessed the influence of trip, child, and household characteristics on
   the decision to walk to school.
   Results: In 2009, 12.7% of K-8 students usually walked or biked to
   school compared with 47.7% in 1969. Rates of walking and biking to
   school were higher on the trip home from school in each survey year.
   During the morning peak period, school travel accounted for 5%-7% of
   vehicle miles traveled in 2009 and 10%-14% of all private vehicles on
   the road.
   Conclusions: There have been sharp increases in driving children to
   school since 1969 and corresponding decreases in walking to school. This
   increase is particularly evident in the number of vehicle trips
   generated by parents dropping children at school and teens driving
   themselves. The NHTS survey provides a unique opportunity to monitor
   these trends in the future. (Am J Prev Med 2011;41(2):146-151) (C) 2011

AB Germany and the USA have among the highest motorization rates in the
   world. Yet Germans make a four times higher share of trips by foot,
   bike, and public transport and drive for a 25% lower share of trips as
   Americans. Using two comparable national travel surveys this paper
   empirically investigates determinants of transport mode choice in
   Germany and the USA.
   In both countries higher population density, a greater mix of land-uses,
   household proximity to public transport, and fewer cars per household
   are associated with a lower share of trips by automobile. However,
   considerable differences remain: all groups of society in America are
   more car-dependent than Germans. Even controlling for dissimilarities in
   socio-economic factors and land-use. Germans are more likely to walk,
   cycle, and use public transport. Moreover, Americans living in dense,
   mixed-use areas, and close to public transport are more likely to drive
   than Germans living in lower density areas, with more limited mix of
   land-uses, and farther from public transport. Differences in transport
   policy that make car travel slower, more expensive, less convenient, and
   alternatives to the automobile more attractive in Germany may help
   account for the remaining differences. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This paper reviews trends in cycling levels, safety, and policies in
   Canada and the USA over the past two decades. We analyze aggregate data
   for the two countries as well as city-specific case study data for nine
   large cities (Chicago, Minneapolis, Montreal, New York, Portland, San
   Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, and Washington). Cycling levels have
   increased in both the USA and Canada, while cyclist fatalities have
   fallen. There is much spatial variation and socioeconomic inequality in
   cycling rates. The bike share of work commuters is more than twice as
   high in Canada as in the USA, and is higher in the western parts of both
   countries. Cycling is concentrated in central cities, especially near
   universities and in gentrified neighborhoods near the city center.
   Almost all the growth in cycling in the USA has been among men between
   25-64 years old, while cycling rates have remained steady among women
   and fallen sharply for children. Cycling rates have risen much faster in
   the nine case study cities than in their countries as a whole, at least
   doubling in all the cities since 1990. They have implemented a wide
   range of infrastructure and programs to promote cycling and increase
   cycling safety: expanded and improved bike lanes and paths, traffic
   calming, parking, bike-transit integration, bike sharing, training
   programs, and promotional events. We describe the specific
   accomplishments of the nine case study cities, focusing on each city's
   innovations and lessons for other cities trying to increase cycling.
   Portland's comprehensive package of cycling policies has succeeded in
   raising cycling levels 6-fold and provides an example that other North
   American cities can follow. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The last decade has seen a substantial increase in the perception of the
   bicycle as a realistic transport alternative to the car. Bicycle-sharing
   schemes are now a reality in many European cities. They can be large
   scale or small scale and their use is clearly on the increase. The
   sharing systems are initially free and then start to charge in order to
   cover the system running costs and the maintenance of the bicycles. This
   paper proposes a complete methodology for introducing bike-sharing
   systems. A methodology is proposed for calculating the potential demand
   for bicycle use and the willingness to pay of future users for faster
   journey times, as well as a location model for fixing the bicycle
   pick-up and drop-off stations made with the help of a geographical
   information system. The proposed methodology determines the personal
   profile of the system users, the maximum tariffs to charge in order to
   guarantee a good take-up, the best system to introduce and the optimum
   locations of the docking stations, which will depend on certain
   predetermined criteria.

   adolescents were included. PA was objectively measured with
   accelerometry. Commuting patterns and overall PA were self-reported
   using questions from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire
   modified for adolescents (IPAQ-A). Adolescents reported to spend 30 min
   (15,60) [expressed as median (25th, 75th percentiles)] walking. In boys,
   associations between active commuting (walking and biking) and PA levels
   were observed for moderate, moderate-to-vigorous and overall PA. In
   girls, these associations were observed for moderate and
   moderate-to-vigorous PA (walking). Similar results were found with the
   IPAQ-A. We observed positive associations between overall commuting and
   PA levels in European adolescents, yet due to the cross-sectional study
   design we cannot state the direction of these. Future studies should
   address the causation between active commuting and PA levels.

   In this article, we present a case study of the CHP program and discuss
   the review of city development rezoning applications as a successful
   strategy to link public health to urban planning. Prior to the CHP
   review, 7% of development applications in Columbus included active
   transportation components; in 2009, 64% of development applications
   adopted active transportation components specifically recommended by the
   CHP review. Active transportation recommendations generally included
   adding bike racks, widening or adding sidewalks, and providing sidewalk
   connectivity. Recommendations and lessons learned from CHP are provided.

AB Travel demand management (TDM) for achieving sustainability is now
   considered one of the most important aspects of transportation planning
   and operation. It is now a well known fact that excessive use of private
   car results inefficient travel behaviour. So, from the TDM perspective,
   it is of great importance to analyze travel behaviour for improving our
   understanding on how to influence people to reduce car use and choose
   more sustainable modes such as carpool, public transit, park & ride,
   walk, bike etc. This study attempts an in-depth analysis of commuting
   mode choice behaviour using a week-long commuter survey data set
   collected in the City of Edmonton. Using error correlated nested logit
   model for panel data, this study investigates sensitivities of various
   factors including some specific TDM policies such as flexible office
   hours, compressed work week etc. Results of the investigation provide
   profound understanding and guidelines for designing effective TDM

   Exposure to genotoxic compounds in the ambient air is evaluated using
   different biomarkers. In the present study we assessed DNA-adducts
   levels in apparently healthy people living and working in the city of
   Cotonou (Benin) in which exposure to air pollutants such as benzene and
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) mainly benzo(a)pyrene has been
   evidenced. Rural inhabitants were enrolled as control group.
   Taxi-motorbike drivers, street food vendors, and gasoline salesmen were
   recruited in Cotonou whereas suburban residents were recruited in
   Godomey, 12 km from Cotonou. We found that taxi-motorbike drivers,
   roadside residents, street vendors, taxi-motor-bike drivers and gasoline
   sellers had significantly higher levels of DNA-adducts than suburban and
   village inhabitants (P < 0.001; post hoc, LSD). Means values were 24.6
   +/- 6.4, 23.78 +/- 6.9, 34.7 +/- 9.8, and 37.2 +/- 8.1 in the exposed
   groups versus 2.1 +/- 0.6 and 3.1 +/- 0.8 adducts/10(8) nucleotides, in
   the two control groups, respectively. We did not find any significant
   difference within the high exposure groups and inside low exposure
   subgroups (namely suburban residents and villagers) because the mean
   individual exposure values to both PAHs and benzene were similar among
   subjects exposed in the city of Cotonou and those in suburban and
   village areas. However, there is significant interindividual variations
   in adducts levels that may reflect variation of genetic susceptibility
   factors. Ranges of adduct level/10(8) nucleotides were: 1-69, 1-76,
   3-169, 4-124, 0-9, 0-8 adducts/10(8) for taxi-motorbike drivers,
   roadside residents, street vendors, gasoline sellers, suburban and
   village inhabitants, respectively. Our study demonstrated a clear-cut
   elevated level of DNA adducts in city residents than in none exposed
   people (or very low exposure levels people) and designate these city
   residents groups as people at risks for the chronic diseases possibly
   caused by benzene and PAHs. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Environ

   command blocks inspired by the Scratch programming environment [2].
   Modkit tools work with the Arduino [3] platform's library of code (such
   as C/C++) to enable users to participate in a community rich with
   project ideas and sample files. Modkit supports multiple representations
   of code - graphical command blocks can become editable text-based code
   to offer additional avenues for learning and sharing. The Studio
   welcomes members of the research, industrial, academic, maker, and
   I-just-want-to-have fun communities of all experience levels to
   participate. Paricipants will have opportunities to use Modkit in
   personally-meaningful ways. Participants who wish to extend Modkit tools
   with new functionality will have opportunities to do so. The organizers
   will conclude the studio with a discussion around activities, example

AB In response to the environmental, economic, and social costs associated
   with overreliance on the automobile, planners and transportation
   professionals are promoting sustainable alternatives such as walking,
   cycling, and public transit, either as single modes or in combination.
   It has been argued that the marriage between cycling and transit
   presents opportunities for synergy by enlarging catchment areas of
   transit stations while drawing in new users to both of these green
   modes. However, because of the marginality of combining cycling and
   transit in North America, there is a shortage of reliable empirical
   studies in this area. The present study addressed this gap through an
   analysis of travel behavior and preferences related to cycle transit
   (C-T) integration. An online survey was conducted in the region of
   Montreal, Canada, during the summer of 2010. The questionnaire included
   a section on Montreal's public bicycle sharing system, Bixi (bicycle
   taxi), and its potential for integration with transit. Three current or
   potential C-T user groups were identified through a factor cluster
   analysis: current parking bike-and-riders, Bixi users, and car drivers.
   Bringing a bicycle on transit was the preferred form of integration;
   however, scenarios involving bicycle parking (or using a public bicycle)
   were likely to be used more regularly. To accommodate the greatest
   number of bicycle transit trips, measures that facilitated parking at
   transit stops and those that enabled the bringing of bicycles on board
   transit vehicles were recommended in tandem.

   Electric Vehicles (EV). Taking into account the new reality of smart
   cites, EV introduction, Smart Grids (SG), Electrical Markets (EM), with
   deregulation of electricity production and use, drivers will need more
   information for decision and mobility purposes. A mobile application to
   recommend useful related information will help drivers to deal with this
   new reality, giving guidance towards traffic, batteries charging
   process, and city mobility infrastructures (e. g. public transportation
   information, parking places availability and car & bike sharing
   systems). Since this is an upcoming reality with possible process
   changes, development must be based on agile process approaches (Web

AB Recognizing the environmental and health benefits of cycling, cities
   around the world are promoting use of the bicycle for everyday
   transportation, but with limited information about the preferences of
   cyclists and the effectiveness of investments in bicycle infrastructure.
   To better understand the decision-making of cyclists, we estimated a
   route choice model with GPS data collected from smartphone users in San
   Francisco. Traces were automatically filtered for activities and mode
   transfers, and matched to a network model. Alternatives were extracted
   using repeated shortest path searches in which both link attributes and
   generalized cost coefficients were randomized. The prior distribution
   for the coefficients was calibrated automatically using only the
   network. A Path Size Multinomial Logit model revealed that bicycle lanes
   were preferred to other facility types, especially by infrequent
   cyclists. Steep slopes were disfavored, especially by women and during
   commutes. Other negative attributes included length and turns. Traffic
   volume, traffic speed, number of lanes, crime rates, and nightfall had
   no effect. Marginal rates of substitution imply a user benefit of bike
   lanes of $0.61 USD per km per trip. Coefficients were applied to a trip
   assignment model that will be used to evaluate prospective investments
   in bicycle infrastructure in San Francisco.

   therefore, the gym popularize everywhere. Popularity of expensive
   fitness equipment to bring a lot of convenience, but different users
   share of fitness equipment have different condition, often caused damage
   by use, which is the most important factor for the material fatigue
   damage. This study chose the exercise bike parts "self run bushing" to
   create a fatigue life assessment mechanism. In this study, to the
   fatigue analysis was conducted, by using finite element analysis
   according to the material S-N curve and Miner cumulative damage theory
   in a series of cyclic loading. To analyze fatigue life, analytical and
   experimental studies through mutual verification were conducted which
   can obtain the expectation life period of the self run bushing. The load

AB This study investigated the relationship between weather conditions and
   cycling ridership, as well as the hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly
   trends for use of urban bicycle facilities. A unique data set of cyclist
   ridership, collected at five automatic counting stations on primarily
   utilitarian bike facilities in the city of Montreal, Canada, was used.
   Absolute and relative ridership models were used to analyze the direct
   and lagging effects of weather variables and extreme weather conditions
   on hourly cyclist volumes. Precipitation, temperature, and humidity had
   significant effects on bicycle ridership. After other factors were
   controlled for, when the temperature doubled, a 43% to 50% increase in
   ridership could be expected; however, the temperature had a negative
   effect when it was higher than 28 C and humidity was greater than 60%.
   The results also showed that bicycle volumes in a given hour were
   significantly affected not only by the presence of rain in the same hour
   but also by the presence of rain in the previous 3 h or in the morning
   only. Daily bicycle volumes were 65% to 89% lower on weekend days than
   on Monday, the weekday with lowest ridership. This finding confirmed
   that the analyzed facilities were primarily utilitarian. Further,
   bicycle volumes peaked in the summer months, with an additional
   ridership of 32% to 39% with respect to April. Finally, bicycle volumes
   increased by approximately 20% to 27% in 2009 and 35% to 40% in 2010
   with respect to 2008 in the cycling facilities under analysis.

AB Over the past 20 years, China has experienced a steady decline in
   bicycle use. To address this trend, China's central and local government
   for urban transportation created Public Transit Priority to encourage
   public transport initiatives. As part of this effort, the government of
   the city of Hangzhou launched Hangzhou Public Bicycle in 2008. This
   service allows members to access a shared fleet of bicycles. As of March
   2011, Hangzhou Public Bicycle operated 60,600 bicycles with 2,416 fixed
   stations in eight core districts. To understand factors leading to
   bikesharing adoption and barriers to adoption, the authors concluded an
   intercept survey in Hangzhou between January and March 2010. Two
   separate questionnaires were issued to bikesharing members and
   nonmembers to identify key differences and similarities between these
   groups. In total, 806 surveys were completed by 666 members and 140
   nonmembers. The authors found that bikesharing was capturing modal share
   from bus transit, walking, autos, and taxis. Approximately 30% of
   members had incorporated bikesharing into their most common commute.
   Members indicated that they most frequently used a bikesharing station
   closest to either home (40%) or work (40%). These modal shifts suggested
   that bikesharing acted as both a competitor and a complement to existing
   public transit. Members exhibited a higher rate of auto ownership than
   nonmembers. This finding suggested that bikesharing was attractive to
   car owners. Recommendations for improving bikesharing in Hangzhou
   included adding stations and real-time bike and parking availability
   technologies, improving bike maintenance and locking mechanisms, and
   extending operational hours.

AB With data from the 2001 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), recent
   research showed that transit's usual share was greater than its actual
   share for workers in the United States in a variety of commuter markets.
   A mode's usual share is the percentage of workers who state that they
   usually use that mode for commuting in a week, whereas the actual share
   of a mode is the percentage of work trips by that mode by the same
   workers on a typical work day. This study explores whether this relative
   relationship between a mode's usual and actual shares holds true for
   common modes other than transit for the United States. Mathematically,
   it is determined that this relative relationship cannot hold true for
   all modes; in other words, the usual share has to be smaller than the
   actual share for one or more modes other than transit. Empirically, the
   same 2001 NHTS is used to test this relative relationship for three
   common modes the privately owned vehicle (POV), walking, and biking and
   for a variety of commuter markets. The empirical results confirm the
   mathematical conclusion that the relative relationship holds true for
   biking but not for POV and walking. In addition, the relationship
   between usual and actual shares is determined not solely by the mode but
   also by individual commuter markets. Finally, the deviation between
   usual and actual shares in percentage terms is large for transit and
   walking, but small for privately operated vehicles and bikes. One
   direction of future research would be to determine the reasons for these
   differences in the usual actual relationship across modes and commuter
   markets.

AB This project began life as an aspiration of an individual client who is

   course of buying some property for an investment, began studying how he
   might develop it. So he embarked on a mission to examine some small
   multi-unit properties to learn about how they fared in the current
   Dallas market.
   After a two-year search, he had become frustrated with the lack of
   modern townhomes on the market, or for that matter, the number that had
   ever existed in a city that doesn't treasure architecture as a part of
   its heritage. The few modern townhome projects that do exist were
   over-designed or full of gimmickry-nothing that could even remotely
   claim art status. He decided to build his own project and move into one
   of the units because he wanted to elevate the Dallas townhome market.
   The site that he ultimately selected was a 90' x 140' parcel located
   about ten minutes north of downtown Dallas. The added attraction of the
   site was that it was bordered on the backside by the Katy Trail, an
   unused railroad line converted into a very popular hike and bike trail.
   The trail today connects Southern Methodist University to downtown
   Dallas and is planned to expand throughout the city. While this location
   was excellent, there were some strings attached. At the time, the
   property was being used as a parking lot for a neighboring business
   because it had been rezoned for that purpose some years earlier.

AB Background: The high mechanical efficiency of the geared handcycle makes
   it suitable for elite athletes to train and even compete in races with
   able-bodied (recreational) cyclists. However, the actual exercise
   profile for endurance events has not been quantified.
   Objective: To guide future training regimes in a safe and effective
   process, the aim of this research was to quantify the workload, speed,
   cadence and heart rate parameters during 6000 km of training and within
   a 540 km ultra-long races.
   Methods: One spinal cord injured participant (lesion level Th4, ASIA B)
   handcycle (modified Shark S Sopur-Sunrisemedical, Malsch, Germany) was
   equipped with Schoberer Bike Measurement System (SRM) crank. For the
   laboratory test, a Cyclus II Ergometer was used. The energy intake and
   quality was determined during the time of race (540 km).
   Results: Workload at a defined metabolic situation was augmented through
   training by 63.8% from 90.0 to 147.6 W. The athlete finished the 540 km
   race with an average speed of 21.6 kmh(-1) and a total race time of
   38:52 h.
   Conclusions: Ultra-long-term races in a handcycle can be suited by
   well-trained persons with a spinal cord injury. The quality of the
   training preparation time (for example, intensity and volume) is of
   immense importance to reach an adequate physiological capacity and to
   avoid serious injuries or medical problems. Spinal Cord (2010) 48,

AB Despite a burgeoning literature on mobilities in general and cycling in
   particular as a transport, leisure, and political practice, there
   remains a lack of research on cycling in pedestrian public spaces. There
   is, however, a substantial body of literature in relation to
   skateboarding in public spaces which with few exceptions theorises it as
   resistant to preexisting dominant design codes and social norms. Using
   the example of London's South Bank this paper focuses on the urban
   cycling practices of bike trials and BMX in order to illustrate that
   these practices are perhaps not as 'resistant' as previous accounts have
   argued. Whilst accounts of skateboarding have tended to draw upon a
   body-architecture dialectics and subcultural theory, using ethnographic
   methods this paper discusses the practice and reception of display,
   sociality, and authority inherent in these public performances. In doing
   so the paper demonstrates that these styles of riding largely perform
   the social and cultural norms enshrined in the redevelopment of the
   South Bank. The result is a performed reading of these practices and
   spaces which sees power as always becoming. In line with this, the paper
   also questions the logic of current strategies which seek to displace
   riders and skaters to peripheral 'private' skate parks based on an
   erroneous reading of such practices as always resistant.

AB Minor bicycle accidents are defined as "bicycle accidents not involving
   death or heavily injured persons, implying that possible hospital visits
   last less than 24 hours". Statistics about these accidents and related
   injuries are very poor, because they are mostly not reported to police,
   hospitals or insurance companies. Yet, they form a major share of all
   bicycle accidents. Official registrations underestimate the number of
   minor accidents and do not provide cost data, nor the distance cycled.
   Therefore related policies are hampered by a lack of accurate data.
   This paper provides more insight into the importance of minor bicycle
   accidents and reports the frequency, risk and resulting costs of minor
   bicycle accidents. Direct costs, including the damage to bike and
   clothes as well as medical costs and indirect costs such as productivity
   loss and leisure time lost are calculated. We also estimate intangible
   costs of pain and psychological suffering and costs for other parties
   involved in the accident. Data were collected during the SHAPES project
   using several electronic surveys. The weekly prospective registration
   that lasted a year, covered 1187 persons that cycled 1,474,978 km. 219
   minor bicycle accidents were reported. Resulting in a frequency of 148
   minor bicycle accidents per million kilometres. We analyzed the economic
   costs related to 118 minor bicycle accidents in detail. The average
   total cost of these accidents is estimated at 841 euro (95% CI:
   579-1205) per accident or 0.125 euro per kilometre cycled. Overall,
   productivity loss is the most important component accounting for 48% of
   the total cost. Intangible costs, which in past research were mostly
   neglected, are an important burden related to minor bicycle accidents
   (27% of the total cost). Even among minor accidents there are important
   differences in the total cost depending on the severity of the injury.

AB This article argues for an understanding of public transit spaces as
   sites of multiple dynamic interactions. Much inspired by the approach of
   Erving Goffman, the article explore a "mobilized" understanding of some
   of his central concepts. The theoretical underpinning is the development
   of concepts related to interaction, mobility, and transit that focus on
   notions of the "mobile with," "negotiation in motion," "mobile sense
   making," and "temporary congregations." The theoretical approach aims at
   seeing public transit spaces as sites where cars, pedestrians, mopeds,
   and bikes on a regular basis "negotiate" not only routes in and across
   the space but also express dynamic flows of interaction in motion. The
   claim is that what seems like ordinary urban movement patterns are more
   than this. By moving in the city among buildings, objects, and people,
   one interacts with the "environment," making sense of it and ultimately
   producing culture and identity. Empirically, Nytorv square in Aalborg,
   Denmark, is mapped and analyzed through recurrent field studies. The
   article aims at unpacking the geography of mobility at the site of
   Nytorv by applying the two perspectives of the "river" and the "ballet"
   to the mobile practices of the site.

AB This paper presents the first route choice model for bicyclists
   estimated from a large sample of GPS observations and overcomes the
   limitations inherent in the generally employed stated preference
   approach. It employs an improved mode detection algorithm for GPS
   post-processing to determine trips made by bicycle, which are map
   matched to an enriched street network. The alternatives are generated as
   a random sample from an exhaustive, but constrained search. Accounting
   for the similarity between the alternatives with the path-size factor
   the MNL estimates show that the elasticity with regards to trip length
   is nearly four times larger than that with respect to the share of bike
   paths. The elasticity with respect to the product of length and maximum
   gradient of the route is small. No other variable describing the routes
   had an impact. The heterogeneity of the cyclists is captured through
   interaction terms formulated on their average behaviour. (C) 2010

AB BACKGROUND: Any penetrating trauma to the neck may cause damage to great
   vessels resulting in massive bleeding or injury to the trachea,
   esophagus or spinal cord. Such injuries sometimes pose a real intubation
   challenge. METHODS (CASE REPORT): We report a case of penetrating neck
   injury with isolated but extensive tracheal laceration. The sharp curved
   hook of a heavy automobile entered through suprasternal area of neck of
   a bike rider in a road accident. The patient presented with right-sided
   pneumothorax and respiratory collapse. Bronchoscopy revealed injuries at
   two sites in the trachea. The patient was intubated with unique method
   of double tube intubation. Injuries of trachea were repaired by right
   thoracotomy and midline cervicotomy. RESULTS: The patient made an
   uneventful recovery by this unique method of intubation and tracheal
   repair. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated tracheal injuries are very rare in
   penetrating road accident wounds and the intubation and operative
   strategy may change according to bronchoscopic findings.

AB Background: Dental injuries in children and adolescents living across
   the globe are a serious public health problem. There are no data on
   dental injuries in United Arab Emirates (UAE). For the development of
   effective preventive measures, the present study was conducted to
   investigate the etiology and environment where dental injuries occurred,
   and to assess the relationship between traumatic dental injuries and
   socioeconomic status. Material and Methods: This study was undertaken in
   different colleges of University of Sharjah, UAE. 412 participants aged
   18-22years were screened using Dental Trauma Index (DTI), following the
   questionnaire phase of the study. Results: Prevalence of dental injury
   was 25.9%, mostly (46.9%) with restored teeth; followed by 42.3% of
   minor injury (untreated enamel fracture), affecting one upper central
   incisor (53%). The mean age at the time of dental injury was 10.5 years
   (SD = 1.52; range 8-13 years) in females vs 14 years (SD = 1.71; range
   12-16 years) in males. Dental injuries among males mostly occurred at
   public places such as on streets (27%) with (19%) of injuries were
   related to motor bike/micro scooters followed by bicycles (17%) and
   traffic accidents (9%). Socioeconomic indicators chosen were not
   statistically significant with the exception of family income (P -
   0.01). Conclusion: The findings of this study show that dental traumas
   are prevalent among middle and high socioeconomic groups. There is a
   need for potential interventions like educating parents, caretakers, and
   older siblings on how to reduce the risk factors related to dental
   injuries.

AB Purpose. To provide evidence about the types of transportation
   infrastructure that support bicycling
   Design. Population-based survey with pictures to depict 16 route types.
   Setting. Metro Vancouver, Canada.
   Subjects. 1402 adult current and potential cyclists, i.e., the "near
   market" for cycling (representing 31% of the population).
   Measures. Preference scores for each infrastructure type (scale from 1,
   very unlikely to use, to +1, very likely to use); current frequency of
   use of each infrastructure type (mean number of times/y).
   Analyses. Descriptive statistics across demographic segments; multiple
   linear regression.
   Results. Most respondents were likely or very likely to choose to cycle
   on the following broad route categories: off-street paths (71%-85% of
   respondents); physically separated routes next to major roads (71%); and
   residential routes (48%-65%). Rural roads (21%-49%) and routes on major
   streets (16%-52%) were least likely to be chosen. Within the broad
   categories, routes with traffic calming, bike lanes, paved surfaces, and
   no on-street parking were preferred, resulting in increases in
   likelihood of choosing the route from 12% to 37%. Findings indicate a
   marked disparity between preferred cycling infrastructure and the route
   types that were currently available and commonly used.
   Conclusion. This study provides evidence for urban planners about
   bicycling infrastructure designs that could lead to an increase in
   active transportation. (Am J Health Promot 2010;25[1]:40-47.)

AB Mountain biking is a popular activity in urban areas, including in
   forest remnants in Australia cities. To increase the technical challenge
   for riders, trail technical features such as jumps, bridges, mounds and
   ditches, along with informal trails are often constructed without
   authorisation. We assessed the social, environmental and management
   challenges associated with the presence of such features, developed a
   method for assessing them, and then used this method to examine them in
   an endangered forest within the Gold Coast in Australia. In a 29 ha
   remnant of Blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) forest there were 116
   unauthorised features, mostly jumps, ditches and mounds, which
   collectively resulted in an area of 1601 m(2) of bare soil and 4010 m(2)
   of undergrowth cleared. Features differed in their size, construction
   materials used, and their impacts on the environment. Although nearly
   two thirds had low to moderate safety, most were in moderate to good
   condition, had fall zones and optional routes for riders. Management
   options for land managers, in this case a publicly funded University,
   include (1) feature removal and site rehabilitation, (2) conversion to
   official features, (3) removal and provision of an alternative location
   for official features, or (4) maintain the status quo. There are social,
   financial and environmental benefits and limitations to each of these
   options highlighting that unauthorised trail technical features are a
   challenge for planners and managers that often have no easy solution.

AB China has seen explosive growth in the sales of electric bikes since
   1998. The boom was triggered by Chinese local governments' efforts to
   restrict motorcycles in city centers. However, many Chinese cities have
   started to extend the restriction to electric bikes. Whether China's
   electric bike economy will continue to develop is highly uncertain. The
   experience of China's electric bike boom suggests that limiting the
   fossil-fueled alternatives could be an effective policy tool in
   fostering the commercialization of electric vehicles. The failure of
   Taiwan's electric scooter policy, on the other hand, indicates that
   subsidies alone may not be a sufficient launching strategy. The policy
   approach of limiting the alternatives deserves serious consideration if

AB Background: Recent research demonstrates the importance of targeting the
   built environment to support individual physical activity, particularly
   for people experiencing health disparities. Master plans to promote
   biking and/or pedestrians (BPMPs) are a potential method for
   environmental change. This descriptive study aims to provide a snapshot
   of plan attributes and better understand demographic, social and
   transportation characteristics of communities with BPMPs. Methods: We
   collected a census sample of BPMPs from 4 states. Population and
   commuting data were obtained from national statistics. Results: 294
   master plans were included, with most plans representing municipalities.
   62% of plans targeted biking only, one-fifth targeted biking and
   walking, and 15% targeted walking only. The sampled locations have a
   similar demographic profile as the overall U.S. for median age and
   household Income, people of color, high school education, and income
   inequality. The degree of racial diversity of sampled communities is
   slightly less than the U S. average and the percentage of people who
   walk to work were slightly higher. Conclusions: Given that communities
   with master plans have a similar profile as the overall U.S., BPMPs
   could feasibly be spread to communities throughout the country. Further
   research is planned to describe BPMPs in detail toward informing future
   plan development

   in the wake of the 2004 Republican National Convention, I explore the
   assumptions underpinning the regulation of bicycling as a mode of
   protest. In addition to analyzing these regulatory and legal frameworks
   to highlight how they suppress bicycling as protest, this case study
   illustrates how police practices work in tandem with the law to erode
   the potential for alternative mobilities and citizenships to flourish.
   Through 'command and control' policing and regulatory tactics, the New
   York Police Department is deterring cyclists from participating in group
   bike rides and is carrying out low-level harassment of 'ordinary'
   cyclists. The experience of New York City's cyclists shows that in
   addition to changes to infrastructure and transportation policies,
   changes to the rules, regulations and practices governing protest will
   be necessary for alternative mobilities to fully flourish.

   Outre l'analyse de ces systemes reglementaires et juridiques pour

   se conjuguent a la loi pour miner le developpement potentiel de

   dissuade les cyclistes de prendre part a des promenades en groupe et se

AB Capital city of the region of Burgundy, Dijon, like many French cities,
   has now embarked into a strategy of eco-development, putting
   sustainability in the center the public discourse of urban planning.
   City planning is run by the Communaute d'agglomeration Dijonnaise,
   "Grand Dijon", with competencies in transportation, housing and land use
   planning. According to French laws, a greater emphasis must now be given
   to "solidarity" in the governance of urban areas, which implies
   requirements for social housing in all municipalities, but also to
   sustainability and "green" urban policies. The PLU "Plans Locaux
   d'Urbanisme" must become "eco-PLU", reflecting the increasing importance
   of environmental concerns in the development of cities. A strong linkage
   must be established between housing and building programs on one side,
   public transportation on the other side. New neighborhoods must be
   planned with good public transport access, and transport routes must be
   reorganized to foster maximal ridership. Dijon, after about 20 other
   French cities, is rediscovering the virtues of street cars (tramways),
   considered as a cleaner way to carry population than automobiles or
   fossil fuel-powered city buses. The implementation of a 2-line streetcar
   scheme will mean a reorganization of urban centralities in the Dijon
   area. The city is also encouraging the use of bicycles, with bike-rental
   programs, in the downtown area and around the university campus.
   Construction sites must be as "green" as possible, As a mid-size city in
   France, Dijon appears as a good example of the current trends in city
   greening around Western Europe. The label of "green city" has in fact
   become essential in the promotion of urban areas for tourism and job
   creations, as is shown by the city rankings published in mainstream
   magazines.

PY 2010
AB European countries and cities are promoting its use as an
   environmentally-friendly way to move around cities. The bicycle is part
   of the daily-life culture of nations such as the Netherlands. It is also
   making a noticeable comeback in French cities. After a few pioneering
   cities in the 1990's, many cities have embarked into self-service public
   bike rental programs, following the example of Volov' in Lyon, France's
   second largest city, in 2005, and the powerful impact of the deployment
   of Velib in Paris (July 2007). In most cases, the cities have contracted
   with a major advertising company. In exchange for being awarded the
   outside advertising and bus shelters markets, the advertisers will
   provide and maintain the bicycles and the bicycle docking points which
   use a proprietary locking system to ensure that each bike is securely
   stored. This model has spread to other countries in Europe. Bicycle
   stations are mostly located in downtown areas, and one of the weaknesses
   of the whole scheme is that suburban areas are excluded. The early model
   is evolving, since public transport conglomerates such as Transdev,
   Keolis or Veolia are now getting in the bicycle providing game. Public
   policies for bicycles also include the provision of bicycle lanes.

AB This study tests the hypothesis that marking narrower parking lanes can
   create additional operating space for bicyclists by inducing motorists
   to park closer to the curb. Parking offset (i.e., distance between the
   curb and a parallel parked car) was measured along two multilane urban
   arterials just outside Boston, Massachusetts, with parking lanes ranging
   from 6 to 9 ft wide. As parking lane width grew in progression from 6 to
   7 to 8 to 9 ft, the fraction of cars parked more than 12 in. from the
   curb, the legal limit, increased in a corresponding progression from 1%
   to 13% to 44% to 60%. The authors argue that 95 percentile parking
   offset is a better measure of impact on bicyclist operating space than
   is mean parking offset, because when riding next to a parking lane,
   cyclists tend to choose a path that envelopes most parked cars, such
   that they need to deliberately maneuver around only about one parked car
   out of 20. With each additional foot of parking lane width, 95
   percentile offset increased by about 5 in., for a response of 0.44 ft/ft
   or m/m. Multivariate regression indicates that wide vehicles (e.g.,
   vans, large sport-utility vehicles) partially compensate by parking
   about I in. closer to the curb. Effects of adjacent lane width, whether
   there is an adjacent bike lane, and parking regulation type (meter or
   not) were found to have no significant impact on parking offset. These
   results imply that in cities that display this level of response to
   parking lane width, additional operating space for bicycling can be
   gained by marking narrower parking lanes.

   or meaningful combinations of those events and launching managing rules
   as a reaction. In this work we propose to use Complex Event Processing
   (CEP) as a supervision method for bike hiring services. The idea is to
   use CEP as a monitoring strategy. The events are generated by the system
   when users pick up or leave bikes from /to the depots distributed across
   the city. CEP allows describing the behaviour of the overall cycling
   system as a set of events, complex events and rules. It can monitor
   users' behaviour and trigger alarms in order to apply the corresponding
   billing penalties. Our CEP prototype has been tested using data
   extracted from the Barcelona cycling (Bicing) system. The preliminary
   results show he benefits of using such technology for monitoring
   purposes in distributed environments as the public cycling transport.

   heritage of a region. The DIWI consists of a service oriented
   architecture (SOA), a web-client, a content management system and a
   mobile client based on smart phones and windows mobile technology. Users
   can generate their own POIs (called Parlance Points) at a location and
   share them immediately with other users reaching these locations. An
   extended user test was carried out in the "Grebbelinie" area, the
   Netherlands. The testers hiked and biked via different routes through
   that area using the application. Despite a number of technical
   shortcomings of the UMTS transmission in a rural area, the DIWI was
   positively valued by the testers, but the added value of the information
   of the Parlance Point was limited. But for personal use the PP does have
   an additional value.

AB As road safety audits (RSAs) have been implemented by agencies across
   the United States, transportation professionals have realized that RSAs
   are an effective tool to proactively improve the future safety
   performance of a roadway during the planning and design stages and to
   identify safety issues in existing transportation facilities. But
   limited study has been done of the implementation of RSA recommendations
   on existing roadways. The Utah Local Technical Assistance Program Center
   conducted an RSA of 1309 East in Salt Lake City, Utah. The rapid
   implementation of the recommendations was one of the major successes of
   the project. In addition, a public involvement process refined the
   recommendations and helped develop a consensus that the safety
   improvements implemented would be accepted. The result of the safety
   audit was the implementation of countermeasures that should increase the
   safety of the roadway. The ability to introduce a bike lane and
   signalized crosswalks had a significant impact toward the goal of making
   roads more pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly and implementing a "complete
   street" solution. The roadway is now much more accessible to pedestrians
   and bicyclists while maintaining much of the mobility already in place
   for motorized vehicles.

AB Public bicycle-sharing (bike share) programs have become increasingly
   popular in recent years, particularly in Europe, with a number of cities
   recently implementing systems and high levels of usage. North American
   efforts have been more limited to date, with high-profile recent
   examples including a small program in Washington, D.C., and a
   substantial seasonal program in Montreal, Canada. Because there are no
   established large-scale programs in the United States, planners
   exploring potential system designs and feasibilities are faced with an
   unusual degree of uncertainty about who would ride, where they might
   ride, and how often they might ride. A large-scale bike share system is
   under consideration in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This paper discusses
   the methods and findings of a two-phase project that (a) used a
   raster-based geographic information system analysis to identify a
   primary geographic market area for a bike share program and (b) applied
   bike share trip diversion rates observed in peer European cities to
   estimate daily bike share trips in the primary market area. This
   analysis resulted in estimates for daily usage in Philadelphia that
   ranged from roughly 6,000 to 23,000 for two scales of market area and
   three demand scenarios (low, middle, and high). As bike share systems
   continue to proliferate in different settings, new data can refine the
   methods used here to provide increasing levels of certainty in the
   future.

AB The importance of green areas is increasingly considered for the
   restoration of urban ecosystems. Worldwide studies concerning people
   needs in urban landscapes have underlined the fundamental role carried
   out by greening in the cities not only for social and aesthetical
   reasons, but also for environmental aims. Problems like soil erosion,
   river flooding, lack of biodiversity are frequent in urban contexts and,
   in the last decade, ecological planning and design methods were often
   applied. In particular, the application of bioengineering and ecological
   principles at the urban scale represents an interesting novelty. For
   this purpose an interdisciplinary approach is needed, agronomists and
   architects have to work together in order to solve both ecological and
   technical problems. Therefore, in this study authors looked at the use
   of bioengineering techniques in some recent interesting examples in
   urban green areas in Piedmont (north-western Italy). The proper employ
   of methods (seeding; plantations, rock walls, piling walls), materials
   (wood, stone, geotextiles, biotextiles) and species (grasses and herbs,
   shrubs and trees) were analysed. Differences from criteria used in
   mountain contexts, advantages and limits of these techniques in urban
   areas and their possible application along banks of rivers, slopes,
   roads, footpaths or bike paths were pointed out.

AB Objectives. To assess existing research on the effects of various
   interventions on levels of bicycling. Interventions include
   infrastructure (e.g., bike lanes and parking), integration with public
   transport, education and marketing programs, bicycle access programs,
   and legal issues.
   Methods. A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed and non-reviewed
   research identified 139 studies. Study methodologies varied considerably
   in type and quality, with few meeting rigorous standards. Secondary data
   were gathered for 14 case study cities that adopted multiple
   interventions.
   Results. Many studies show positive associations between specific
   interventions and levels of bicycling. The 14 case studies show that
   almost all cities adopting comprehensive packages of interventions
   experienced large increases in the number of bicycle trips and share of
   people bicycling.
   Conclusions. most of the evidence examined in this review supports the
   crucial role of public policy in encouraging bicycling. Substantial
   increases in bicycling require an integrated package of many different,
   complementary interventions, including infrastructure provision and
   pro-bicycle programs, supportive land use planning, and restrictions on
   car use. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Bicycling is an affordable, environmentally friendly alternative
   transportation mode to motorized travel. A common task performed by
   bikers is to find good routes in an area, where the quality of a route
   is based on safety, efficiency, and enjoyment. Finding routes involves
   trial and error as well as exchanging information between members of a
   bike community. Biketastic is a platform that enriches this
   experimentation and route sharing process making it both easier and more
   effective. Using a mobile phone application and online map
   visualization, bikers are able to document and share routes, ride
   statistics, sensed information to infer route roughness and noisiness,
   and media that documents ride experience. Biketastic was designed to
   ensure the link between information gathering, visualization, and
   bicycling practices. In this paper, we present architecture and
   algorithms for route data inferences and visualization. We evaluate the
   system based on feedback from bicyclists provided during a two-week
   pilot.

AB Growing concerns about global motorization and climate change have led
   to increasing interest in sustainable transportation alternatives such
   as bikesharing (the shared use of a bicycle fleet). Since 1965,
   bikesharing has grown across the globe on five continents: Europe, North
   America, South America, Asia, and Australia. Today, approximately 100
   bikesharing programs are operating in an estimated 125 cities, with more
   than 139,300 bicycles. Bikesharing's evolution is categorized into three
   generations: (a) white bikes (or free bike systems), (b) coin-deposit
   systems, and (c) information technology-based systems. In this paper, a
   fourth generation is proposed: demand-responsive, multimodal systems. A
   range of existing bikesharing business models (e.g., advertising) and
   lessons learned are discussed, including (a) bicycle theft and
   vandalism, (b) bicycle redistribution, (c) information systems (e.g.,
   real-time information), (d) insurance and liability concerns, and (e)
   prelaunch considerations. Although limited in number, several studies
   have documented bikesharing's social and environmental benefits, which
   include reduced auto use, increased bicycle use, and a growing awareness
   of bikesharing as a daily mobility option. Despite bikesharing's ongoing
   growth, obstacles and uncertainty remain: these include future demand,
   safety, sustainability of business models, limited cycling
   infrastructure, challenges to integrate with public transportation
   systems, technology costs, and user convenience (e.g., limited height
   adjustment on bicycles, lack of cargo space, and exposure to weather).
   More research is needed fora better understanding of bikesharing's
   effects, operations, and business models in light of its reported growth
   and benefits.

AB Background: Somerville, Massachusetts, an ethnically diverse, urban
   community northwest of Boston, presents opportunities and challenges for
   active living. With a dense street grid, well-maintained sidewalks,
   neighborhood parks, and existing Community Path, Somerville is very
   walkable. However, two major Surface arteries traverse and bisect
   neighborhoods, creating pedestrian safety and environmental justice
   issues.
   Intervention: Major goals included promoting increased collaboration and
   Communication among existing active-living efforts; managing the
   Community Path extension project; encouraging Portuguese-speaking adults
   to incorporate daily physical activity; leveraging existing urban
   planning work to establish secure, attractive walking/biking corridors;
   and embedding active-living messages in everyday life.
   Results: The Somerville Active Living by Design Partnership (ALbD)
   successfully created a robust task force that was integrated with
   citywide active-living efforts, secured resources to increase
   infrastructure and support for active living, including city-level
   coordinator positions, and changed decision-making practices that led to
   incorporation of pedestrian and bicycle transportation priorities into
   city planning and that influenced the extension of the Community Path.
   Lessons learned: Partnerships must employ sustainability planning early
   on, utilize skilled facilitative leaders to manage leadership
   transitions, and engage new partners. Identifying, cultivating, and
   celebrating champions, especially those with political power, are
   critical. Working closely with research partners leads to rich data
   sources for planning and evaluation. Changing the built environment is
   difficult; working toward smaller wins is realistic and achievable.
   Conclusions: The synergy of ALbD and other community interventions
   created a foundation for short-term Successes and accelerated political-
   cultural changes already underway with respect to active living. (Am J

AB Background: The Partnership for Active Communities brought together
   multidisciplinary organizations to create a 5-year project to support
   increased walking and bicycling in the Sacramento CA area.
   Intervention: Using a Community action model, the partnership focused on
   programs and promotions to expand walk- and bike-to-school programs. The
   partnership focused on policy and physical projects in conducting
   systematic reviews of development projects to influence land use. A
   comprehensive communications plan united diverse partnership interests
   to advocate for Complete Streets policy change and improve
   transportation infrastructure.
   Results: Walk- and bike-to-school programs grew, and community-design
   workshops helped leverage more than $12 million in additional support,
   including Safe Routes to School grants. The partnership delivered more
   than 150 project reviews to city planners, architects, and developers
   with recommendations for improved pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure,
   and many positive changes resulted. Complete Streets is now included as
   a policy in the region's transportation plan, in the mobility element of
   the City's updated general plan and the County's draft circulation plan,
   and in the regional transit master plan.
   Lessons learned: The partnership's communications plan linked partners
   with diverse interests to produce a powerful advocacy network to
   influence adoption of Complete Streets policies. Project development
   reviews were most Successful in Communities that allowed comments at a
   conceptual stage in the process.
   Conclusions: The Partnership for Active Communities produced increased

AB Objective. This study examined the relationship between physical
   activity and the environment among rural Japanese women, and whether
   that relationship varied with driving status.
   Methods. 434 women aged 40-64 years in Unnan City, rural Japan, were
   surveyed in 2006 about physical activity and their neighborhood
   environments. The proximity and frequency of public transport were
   measured using geographic information systems software.
   Results. Perceived good access to public transport and recreational
   facilities, presence of bike lanes, and good aesthetics were among
   factors positively associated with being physically active. The
   interaction between the convenience of bus service and driving status
   was statistically significant (P=0.023). Nondrivers residing in areas
   where bus service was moderately convenient were more likely to be
   active than those who were without it.
   Conclusion. These findings suggested that driving status is a potential
   modifier of the relationship between physical activity and the
   convenience of bus service and that convenient bus service is important
   for promoting physical activity especially in non-drivers. (C) 2009

AB Background: Nashville, Tennessee, formed Music City Moves (MCM), an
   interdisciplinary, countywide partnership to implement its vision for
   the community: a metropolitan region where routine physical activity is
   a fundamental part of daily life for all residents.
   Intervention: Music City Moves' main focus was the pursuit of changes in
   community planning policies to help shape Nashville's built environment
   and facilitate walking and bicycling. To complement this focus, MCM
   developed a suite of health programs to support physical activity in
   high-risk populations and a countywide promotional campaign designed to
   increase awareness and get people active through event participation.
   Results: Nashville made considerable strides in improving policies and
   regulations related to building and site design to improve the built
   environment for pedestrians and cyclists, including passage of (1)
   specific plan zoning; (2) revised subdivision regulations that
   introduced a "walkable Subdivision" option for developers; and (3) a
   community-character manual that will guide future land-use planning.
   Programs and promotions have increased awareness and participation, and
   the Tour de Nash bike/walk event showcases yearly changes in the built
   environment.
   Lessons learned: Political leadership has been critical to MCM's
   success. Leadership of the partnership by the planning department
   facilitated regulatory changes in planning policies.
   Conclusions: Music City Moves has accelerated Nashville's movement to
   improve the built environment and encourage active living. The
   beneficial impact of policy changes will continue to be manifested in
   coming years; however, ongoing political support and education of
   stakeholders in the planning process will be necessary to ensure that
   planning policies are fully implemented. (Am J Prev Med

AB Aim. This article is a critic revision of patients with facial trauma
   admitted in a Ear Nose Throat and Maxillo-Facial Department in a
   mountain touristic city with the aim of investigating the role of winter
   and summer mountains sports and the distribution of maxillo-facial and
   facial accidents.
   Methods. Between 2002 and 2006 a total of 740 patients with
   maxillo-facial injuries were identified, 240 were eligible for this
   study: 42 practiced cross-country biking in summer, 198 practiced ski
   and other winter sports. The study focused on the various types of
   lesions encountered and their sport-specificity on bones and soft
   tissues, on the associated cervical and head trauma, on the recovery
   time and the geographic origin of patients.
   Results. Forty-eight percent of patients underwent surgery; victims were
   usually young male (median age=33 years) with soft tissues lesions:
   lacerations, abrasions, contusions, lost of soft tissues, tatoo lesions,
   important bleedings with emergency recovery and treatment. Face
   fractures were found in 25% of patients, often in the inferior part of
   the face if accident occurred during mountain biking and of the mid-face
   and upper third of the face during winter sports. Medium recovery time
   was three clays. Most of the patients were tourists and
   practioners/inexperts.
   Conclusion. Mountain sport accidents can cause sport-linked typical face
   injury patterns. Mountain bike accidents seems to be decreasing in the
   last years but the number of severe facial trauma reported in winter
   sports and interesting head and cervical trauma, is growing.

AB Background: Jackson, Michigan, is a medium-sized city suffering from a
   bad economy and obesity-related health issues. Nearly 20% of the 36,000
   residents live below the poverty line. It is a relatively young city
   (median age of 30 years) with a mixed ethnicity (20% black, 73% white,
   4% Hispanic). The city offers many structured, active recreational
   opportunities, but has not integrated physical activity into daily life.
   Intervention: Project U-Turn aimed to increase active transportation
   (e.g., biking, walking, and transit use) through an integrated approach
   to Active Living by Design's community action model and the Michigan
   Safe Routes to School model. Resources were focused on active living
   promotions and programs; partnership meetings were the source of changes
   in policy and physical projects. Each initiative was designed to
   introduce each of the 5Ps (preparation, promotion, programs, policy, and
   physical projects) to build support for the partnership's overall work.
   Results: The partnership collected snapshot data of community walking
   and biking behavior, percentage of students walking to school,
   participation in events and programs, and new physical projects. Jackson
   saw a vast improvement in physical infrastructure and policy and a
   related increase in walking and biking in the community.
   Lessons learned: The project engaged in purposeful partnership building
   to implement effective programs and promotions that built support for
   policy and physical projects. Limited resources were best used by
   encouraging partners to contribute and coordinate activities using
   existing staff, funding, and resources.
   Conclusions: Jackson has seen a shift toward awareness of the benefits
   of active living on community health, economic development, and
   environmental awareness. (Am J Prev Med 2009;37(6S2):S329-S335) (C) 2009

AB Background: Older heart failure (HF) patients exhibit exercise
   intolerance during activities of daily living. We hypothesized that
   reduced lower extremity blood flow (LBF) due to reduced forward cardiac
   output would contribute to submaximal exercise intolerance in older HF
   patients.
   Methods and Results: Twelve HF patients both with preserved and reduced
   left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (aged 68 +/- 10 years) without
   large (aorta) or medium sized (iliac or femoral artery) vessel
   atherosclerosis, and 13 age and gender matched healthy volunteers
   underwent a sophisticated battery of assessments including a) peak
   exercise oxygen consumption (peak VO(2)), b) physical function, c)
   cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) submaximal exercise measures of
   aortic and femoral arterial blood flow, and d) determination of thigh
   muscle area. Peak VO(2) was reduced in HF subjects (14 +/- 3 ml/kg/min)
   compared to healthy elderly subjects (20 +/- 6 ml/kg/min) (p = 0.01).
   Four-meter walk speed was 1.35 +/- 0.24 m/sec in healthy elderly verses
   0.98 +/- 0.15 m/sec in HF subjects (p < 0.001). After submaximal
   exercise, the change in superficial femoral LBF was reduced in HF
   participants (79 +/- 92 ml/min) compared to healthy elderly (222 +/- 108
   ml/min; p = 0.002). This occurred even though submaximal stress-induced
   measures of the flow in the descending aorta (5.0 +/- 1.2 vs. 5.1 +/-
   1.3 L/min; p = 0.87), and the stress-resting baseline difference in
   aortic flow (1.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.8 L/min; p = 0.75) were similar
   between the 2 groups. Importantly, the difference in submaximal exercise
   induced superficial femoral LBF between the 2 groups persisted after
   accounting for age, gender, body surface area, LVEF, and thigh muscle
   area (p <= 0.03).
   Conclusion: During CMR submaximal bike exercise in the elderly with
   heart failure, mechanisms other than low cardiac output are responsible
   for reduced lower extremity blood flow.

AB Background: Evidence shows significant relationships between aspects of
   the built environment and physical activity. Land use and transportation
   investments are needed to create environments that support and promote
   physical activity. Methods: The policy relevance of recent evidence on
   the built environment and physical activity is discussed, along with an
   assessment of near, medium, and longer term pricing and regulatory
   actions that could be considered to promote physical activity. These
   actions are evaluated based on their consistency with the current
   evidence on what would support and promote physical activity. Results: A
   wide range of pricing and regulatory strategies are presented that would
   promote physical activity. There is an unmet demand for activity
   friendly, walkable environments. Creating more walkable places is an
   essential component of a national plan to increase physical activity
   levels of Americans. Conclusions: The built environment is an enabler or
   disabler of physical activity. Creating more walkable environments is an
   essential step in averting what is currently a market failure where the
   supply and demand for walkable environments is misaligned. The desire to
   be more physically active would be supported through investments in
   walking, biking, and transit. Concentration of development within
   existing urban areas supported by transit and implementing pricing
   strategies can support physical activity.

AB Background: Jackson, Michigan (population 36,000) started active living
   interventions to help solve residents' low physical activity levels.
   Jackson's experience can serve as a case study for beginning similar
   efforts in smaller communities. Methods: In 2003, Jackson began a
   3-prong community intervention utilizing the 5P model to increase safe
   physical activity opportunities and encourage walking and biking for
   short trips. The focus included work on projects at) elementary schools,
   2) worksites, and 3) city-wide networks. Results: Evaluation results
   show changes in attitudes toward active transportation (8% increase in
   children who thought walking to school was "safer" postintervention),
   intentions to try active transportation (43% of Smart Commute Day
   participants "would" smart commute more often postevent), and increased
   physical activity (the percentage of students walking to school more
   than doubled at 3 of 4 intervention schools). In addition, a community
   level observational study was conducted at 10 locations in the city in
   2005 and 2006. The number of people seen using active transportation
   increased from 1,028 in 2005 to 1,853 people in 2006 (a 63% increase).
   Conclusions: Local community-driven projects to increase walking and
   biking can be effective by utilizing a variety of interventions, from
   the individual to the policy level.

AB This paper presents the results of a study of the influence of
   residential locations on travelling behaviour in the Hangzhou
   Metropolitan Area in China. Based on a combination of quantitative and
   qualitative research methods, the study shows that the location of a
   dwelling, relative to the centre structure of Hangzhou Metropolitan
   Area, can exert a considerable influence on the travelling behaviour of
   the respondents included in the survey. On average, people living close
   to downtown Hangzhou used less energy for transport. They travelled less
   in total and made a greater share of their journeys by bike or on foot.
   The location of the dwelling relative to the closest second-order and
   third-order centre can also influence travelling, but not to the same
   extent as the location of the residence relative to the city centre of
   Hangzhou. The geographical differences in travelling behaviour exist
   independently of residential preferences and attitudes to transport and
   environmental issues and therefore cannot be explained by residential
   self-selection. Instead, a number of rationales for travel behaviour
   identified in the qualitative interviews showed important links in the
   causal mechanisms by which residential location can influence travel.

AB Recent studies have suggested that exposures during traffic
   participation may be associated with adverse health effects. Traffic
   participation involves relatively short but high exposures. Potentially
   relevant exposures include ultrafine particles, fine particles (PM(2.5))
   and noise.
   Simultaneously, detailed real time exposure of particle number
   concentration (PNC), PM(2.5) and noise has been measured while driving
   and cycling 12 predefined routes of approximately 10-20 min duration.
   Sampling took place in eleven medium-sized Dutch cities on eleven
   weekdays in August till October 2006. To investigate variability in
   cyclists exposure, we systematically collected information on
   meteorology, GPS coordinates, type of road, traffic intensity, passing
   vehicles and mopeds while cycling. The overall mean PNC of car drivers
   was 5% higher than the mean PNC of cyclists.
   The overall mean concentration Of PM(2.5) in the car was 11% higher than
   during cycling. Slightly higher 1-min peak concentrations were measured
   in the car (PNC 14%; PM(2.5) 29% for 95-percentiles). Shorter duration
   peaks of PNC were higher during cycling (43% for 99-percentile of 1-s
   averages). Peaks in PNC typically last for less than 10 s. A large
   variability of exposure was found within and between routes. Factors
   that significantly predicted PNC variability during cycling were:
   passing vehicles (mopeds, cars), waiting for traffic lights, passing
   different types of (large) intersections and bicycle lanes and bike
   paths close to motorized traffic. No relation was found between PM(2.5)
   and those predictor variables. The correlation between PNC and noise was
   moderate (median 0.34). PM(2.5) had very low correlations with PNC and
   noise.
   PNC and PM(2.5) exposure of car drivers was slightly higher than that of
   cyclists. PNC was largely uncorrelated with PM(2.5) and reflected local
   traffic variables more than PM(2.5). Different factors were associated
   with high PNC and high noise exposures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

   using the shape analysis of interest points. The extracted trajectories
   are further used for behavioural analysis. The authors present the
   experience from an ongoing study in Stockholm city, where the task was
   to find out if allowing two-way bicycle traffic on one-way streets had
   negative effects on safety. The video analysis system was applied to
   detect biking in the 'wrong' direction and analyse traffic conflicts
   between cyclists and other road users. The manual observations done in
   parallel allowed validating the accuracy of system performance.

AB An estimated 32% of American children are overweight, and physical
   inactivity contributes to this high prevalence of overweight. This
   policy statement highlights how the built environment of a community
   affects children's opportunities for physical activity. Neighborhoods
   and communities can provide opportunities for recreational physical
   activity with parks and open spaces, and policies must support this
   capacity. Children can engage in physical activity as a part of their
   daily lives, such as on their travel to school. Factors such as school
   location have played a significant role in the decreased rates of
   walking to school, and changes in policy may help to increase the number
   of children who are able to walk to school. Environment modification
   that addresses risks associated with automobile traffic is likely to be
   conducive to more walking and biking among children. Actions that reduce
   parental perception and fear of crime may promote outdoor physical
   activity. Policies that promote more active lifestyles among children
   and adolescents will enable them to achieve the recommended 60 minutes
   of daily physical activity. By working with community partners,
   pediatricians can participate in establishing communities designed for
   activity and health.

AB PURPOSE: To analyze physical activity and dietary patterns of
   adolescents and young adults attending evening classes in high schools
   at two socioeconomic and culturally contrasting Cities in Brazil: Recife
   (in northern Brazil) and Florianopolis (in southern Brazil). METHODS:
   This is a cross-sectional analysis (baseline data) of a school-based
   randomized trial (the Saude na Boa project), including 2,147 students
   (15-24 years of age; 55.7% females) from 10 schools in each city,
   pair-matched by size and location. Data were collected by questionnaire.
   RESULTS: Males were more active than females (p<0.001) in all three
   physical activity measures in the questionnaire: days/wk of 60+min of
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) - males 3.8 d/wk (s=2.3),
   females 3.2 d/wk (s=2.4); walk/bike to school - males 4.5 d/wk (s=2.4),
   females 4.1 d/wk (s=2.4); and, strength exercises - males 2.3 d/wk
   (s=2.5), females 0.8 d/wk (s=1.7). The prevalence of physical inactivity
   (zero d/wk of 60+ min MVPA) was significantly higher in Recife
   (p<0.001). Consumption of fruits was significantly higher in Recife than
   in Florianopolis (p<0.001), but no differences were observed for
   vegetable (p=0.28) and soda consumption (p=0.09). In general, one out of
   five students (21.7%) consumed fruits and vegetables <5 d/wk.
   CONCLUSIONS: Students attending evening classes (public high schools) in
   Recife tend to be older but are less likely be employed than their
   counterparts in Florianopolis. Participation in physical education
   classes was much more prevalent in Florianopolis (87.6% x 19.4% in
   Recife), especially for females. The prevalence of less than optimal
   eating habits and insufficient levels of physical activity justify the
   efforts to promote healthier behaviors in this transitional phase in
   life. 
Y4 OBJETIVO: Analisar os padrões de atividade física e hábitos alimentares
   de adolescentes e jovens adultos matriculados no ensino noturno de
   escolas públicas do ensino médio em duas cidades com características
   culturais e socioeconômicas diversas no Brasil: Recife (Região Nordeste)
   e Florianópolis (Região Sul). MÉTODOS: Estudo observacional transversal
   dos dados de base de uma intervenção escolar randomizada (Projeto Saúde
   na Boa), incluindo 2.147 estudantes (15-24 anos; 55,7% do sexo feminino)
   de 10 escolas em cada uma das cidades, pareadas por tamanho e
   localização. Os dados foram coletados por questionário. RESULTADOS: Os
   rapazes foram mais ativos que as moças (p<0,001) em todas as três
   medidas de atividade física no questionário: dias/sem com 60+min de
   atividade física moderada a vigorosa (AFMV) - rapazes 3,8 d/sem
   (DP=2,3), moças 3,2 d/sem (DP=2,4); caminhar ou pedalar para a escola -
   rapazes 4,5 d/sem (DP=2,4), moças 4,1 d/sem (DP=2,4); e exercícios de
   força muscular - rapazes 2,3 d/sem (DP=2,5), moças 0,8 d/sem (DP=1,7). A
   prevalência de inatividade física (zero dias/sem com 60+min de AFMV) foi
   significativamente mais alta em Recife (p<0,001). A frequência de
   consumo de frutas foi mais elevada em Recife do que em Florianópolis
   (p<0,001), não havendo diferença no consumo de legumes e verduras
   (p=0,28) e consumo de refrigerantes (p=0,09). Em geral, um em cada cinco
   estudantes (21,7%) consumia frutas e verduras em menos de cinco dias da
   semana. CONCLUSÕES: Estudantes matriculados no período noturno em
   escolas públicas do ensino médio em Recife tendem a ser mais velhos, mas
   apresentam menor proporção de trabalhadores. A participação em aulas de
   Educação Física era bem mais frequente em Florianópolis (87,6% x 19,4%
   em Recife), particularmente para as moças. A prevalência de hábitos
   alimentares inadequados e insuficiente atividade física justificam os
   esforços para promoção de comportamentos mais saudáveis nesta fase de
   transição da adolescência para a vida adulta.

AB Objective : This paper presents the design of the Virtual Olympic Games
   Framework (VOGF), a computer application designated for athletics,
   health care, general well-being, nutrition and fitness, which offers
   multiple benefits for its participants.
   Background : A special interest in starting the design of the framework
   was in exploring how people can connect and participate together using
   existing computer technologies (i.e. gaming consoles, exercise equipment
   with computer interfaces, devices of measuring health, speed, force and
   distance and Web 2.0 applications).
   Method : A stationary bike set-up offering information to users about
   their individual health and athletic performances has been considered as
   a starting model.
   Conclusions : While this model is in the design stage, some preliminary
   findings are encouraging, suggesting the potential for various fields:
   sports, medicine, theories of learning, technologies and cybercultural
   studies. First, this framework would allow participants to perform a
   variety of sports and improve their health. Second, this would involve
   creating an online environment able to store health information and
   sport performances correlated with accessing multi-media data and
   research about performing sports. Third, participants could share
   experiences with other athletes, coaches and researchers. Fourth, this
   framework also provides support for the research community in their
   future investigations.

AB Over the last 30 years, social theorists have increasingly emphasized
   the importance of space. However, in empirical research, the dialectical
   relationship between social interaction and the physical environment is
   still a largely neglected issue. Using the theory of structuration, I
   provide a concrete example of why and how space matters in the cultural
   analysis of an urban social world. I argue that bike
   messengers-individuals who deliver time-sensitive materials in downtown
   cores of major cities-cannot be understood outside an analysis of space.
   Specifically, I connect the cultural significance of messenger practices
   to the emplacement of those practices inside the urban environment.

AB Introduction: An effective Emergency Medical Service system does not
   exist in Nepal. For an effective EMS system to be developed the scale of
   the problem and the existing facilities need to be studied.
   Methods: Prospective observational study was carried out on 1964
   patients attending Emergency Department at Patan Hospital during one
   month period of September 2006. The patients were specifically enquired
   on mode of transport used, place of origin and whether they called for
   an ambulance or not. Patients triage category at the time of triaging
   was also noted. Information on ambulance service were collected by
   direct interview with the service providers and the total number of
   patients attending Emergency Departments daily were collected from the
   major hospitals of the urban Lalitpur and Kathmandu. MS Excel and SPSS
   software were used for data entry, editing and analysis.
   Results: Total 9.9% patients arrived in ambulance whereas 53.6% came in
   a Taxi, 11.4% came in private vehicle, 13.5% came by bus, 5.4% came by
   bike and the rest 6.2% came by other modes of transportation. Only 13.5%
   of triage category I patients took the ambulance. There were 31 service
   providers with 49 ambulances and 720 patients per day attend Emergency
   Departments in the surveyed area.
   Conclusions: Very less number of patients use the ambulance service for
   emergency services. The available ambulances are not properly equipped
   and do not have trained staff and as such are only a means of
   transportation to the hospitals of urban Lalitpur and Kathmandu.

AB OBJECTIVE: Muscle trauma mainly results from sporting activities and
   accounts for 10 to 55% of sports injuries. However, information on
   optimal muscle trauma management is scarce. The present study sought to
   assess the initial treatment of muscle injury in sportspeople, evaluate
   rehabilitation programs and observe the impact on healing.
   METHODS: We included consecutive patients consulting for severe muscle
   pain with a physician at the Questel Sports Medicine Surgery in the city
   of Brest (western France). The study examined the circumstances of the
   injury, possible antecedents and the initial treatment (with the RICE
   protocol). After clinical and ultrasound examinations, each patient was
   referred to the physiotherapist of his/her choice with an identical
   recovery program (muscle strengthening exercises, cycling on an exercise
   bike and guidance on resuming sport). The patient was subsequently
   interviewed by phone at two time points: four months after the injury,
   to ascertain the date of resumption of gentle sporting activity (e.g.,
   jogging) or return to the pre-injury sporting level (i.e., full
   recovery) and to establish whether the patient and the physiotherapist
   had respectively complied with the prescribed treatment and 15 months
   after the injury, to investigate any re-injury and/or any other muscle
   injuries. The patients were classified into two groups: those who were
   able to resume full sporting activity within 40 days (minor muscle
   injuries: Group 1) and those who were also able to resume full sporting
   activity but only after more than 40 days (major muscle injuries: Group
   2). We, then, compared the two groups in order to identify factors
   potentially related to recovery.
   RESULTS: Ninety-five cases were included in the study; this corresponded
   to 93 patients, two of whom had two different injuries each. The RICE
   protocol: sport was immediately discontinued in 90 cases and shortly
   afterwards in five cases. Ice was applied in 57 cases (60%) and
   compression was applied in 17 cases (17.8%). There were 34 patients
   (35.8%) in Group 1, with an average return to gentle sporting activity
   (jogging) on day 11 post-injury and full resumption of their sport on
   day 23. There were 61 cases (64.2%) in Group 2, with an average return
   to jogging on day 39 and full resumption of their sport on day 69.
   Compliance with the prescription: rehabilitation was performed in only
   62 cases (64.5%), with no major difference between the two groups. In
   terms of the physiotherapist's compliance with the prescription, 40 of
   the 62 patients did some weight training, 29 performed cycling and 58
   were given advice on the resumption of sporting activity. Resumption of
   sport: in both groups, the duration of incapacity did not depend on
   whether rehabilitation had been performed or not. The second phone
   interview yielded a total of 84 replies (88%): seven patients (8%) had
   suffered re-injury in the same muscle group (no difference between
   Groups 1 and 2) and 22 patients (26%) had incurred injuries in another
   muscle group.
   CONCLUSION: The RICE protocol might give better results if compression
   were to be used more extensively. In terms of rehabilitation,
   therapeutic compliance is rather weak and physiotherapists do not fully
   comply with physician's prescription. However, for both minor and major
   injuries, rehabilitation (to the extent that it was implemented by the
   physiotherapists in the present study) did not lead to quicker recovery.

AB France has developed in the last 30 years an impressive network of
   high-speed rail lines. It has had a profound effect on daily mobilities
   as well as new construction and a reorganization of functional space in
   France. New TGV stations are located sometimes at very variable
   distances from original stations and downtowns. Logics of speed - those
   of the SNCF train company - tend of eliminate intermediary stops, but
   local planning and lobbying efforts aim at ensuring that cities are
   adequately served by high-speed trains. Regional governments in charge
   of local intercity rail service are implementing hub rail operations at
   regional stations. Local efforts aim to use TGV stations for urban
   redevelopment by creating intermodal nodes linking rail service and city
   transportation, thru emphasis on "green" urban transport policies
   (light-rail systems, bike-rental schemes). Stations are major urban
   nodes once again. This French experience can be studied for the
   development of high-speed rail networks in Asia and North America.

AB Many studies have examined the impact that the built environment has on
   physical activity. Much existing research posits that if communities
   will provide and improve active infrastructure such as trails,
   sidewalks, and bike lanes, people will become more physically active.
   However, most of these studies have used cross-sectional methods that
   have allowed them to establish correlations but not behavioral
   causality. In this pilot project, a longitudinal design is used to
   assess a trail construction impact on active travel behavior and overall
   physical activity among suburban residents. A sample of suburban
   residents in West Valley City, Utah, was surveyed both before and after
   the construction of a Class I trail in their neighborhood by means of a
   preliminary household survey, individual activity diaries completed at
   three preassigned time points (before and twice after the trail's
   construction), new-resident surveys, and a trail user's intercept
   survey. This intervention technique (the intercept survey) performed a
   more direct test of causality by looking at the same group of residents
   over time and analyzing whether individual changes in behavior occurred
   following the construction of the trail. The paper shows that trail
   neighborhood residents did not use the facility after it was built, new
   residents did not move to the neighborhood because of the trail, and
   users of the trail came from elsewhere. It also discusses trail
   amenities that appear to be the more desirable ones.

AB Objective: Commercial motorcycle transportation and motorbike riding in
   Nigeria is prevalent, and road traffic accidents often result.
   Characteristic of such accidents is massive blood loss, thus exerting
   extreme pressure on the blood bank for replenishment and screening. The
   need to galvanize the system to design a blood bank with minimal
   bureaucracy and easy access led to screening for blood group. A delay in
   accessing blood for the victims leads to higher mortality. Method: Our
   approach was to establish a pre-crash blood data for all auto-bike
   riders who participated in Save Accident Victims Association of Nigeria
   (SAVAN, an indigenous, nongovernmental organization) training program.
   Data used were obtained from 1250 auto-bike riders who volunteered at
   our workshop. Tile grouping method was used for the screening. Results:
   Blood group O positive (54.3%) was the most common blood group type
   among the auto-bike riders studied, with A positive following at 20.3
   percent, B positive at 18.8 percent, O negative at 3.7 percent, AB
   positive at 1.3 percent, B negative at 1.1 percent, and A negative at
   0.5 percent. It was observed that none of the volunteers grouped AB
   negative. Conclusion: Blood group of auto-bike riders, pedestrians,
   passengers, and all potential victims should be documented in their
   identification card to facilitate blood transfusion during major crisis
   or disasters where the facilities for typing are not available.

AB Current concerns surrounding regional air pollution, climate change,
   rising gasoline prices, and urban congestion could presage a substantial
   increase in the bicycle mode share. However, state-of-the-art methods
   for the safe and efficient design of bicycle facilities are based on
   difficult-to-collect data and potentially dubious assumptions regarding
   cyclist behavior. Simulation models offer a way forward, but existing
   bicycling models in the academic literature have not been validated with
   actual data.. These shortcomings are addressed by obtaining real-world
   bicycle data and implementing a multilane, inhomogeneous cellular
   automaton simulation model that can reproduce observations. The existing
   literature is reviewed to inform the data collection and model
   development. It is found that the model emulates field conditions while
   possibly underpredicting bike path capacity. Since the simulation model
   can "observe" individual cyclists, it is ideally suited to determine
   level of service based on difficult-to-observe cycling events such as
   passing. Future work on data collection and model development is
   suggested.

   of transportation were evaluated, including a midsize car, hybrid car,
   motor scooter, city bus, bicycle, and foot. Each mode of transportation
   was evaluated for energy use, cost, convenience, and health and safety
   implications. It was concluded that there is no single mode of
   transportation that is superior in every way. Nonetheless, a few general
   conclusions were reached. Biking was found to be competitive with
   motorized transport for total commutes of six miles or less round trip
   in good weather. After comparing the modes of transportation across all
   categories and multiple commute distances, it is not surprising that the
   personal automobile has become the dominant mode of transportation in
   the US. Its major negative, energy efficiency per passenger mile
   traveled, can be increased through carpooling and the switch to hybrid
   technology. The best option for addressing all four issues however seems
   to be to encourage individuals to live much closer to where they work.

AB Problem: Rates of walking and bicycling to school have declined sharply
   in recent decades, and federal and state governments have committed
   funds to reverse these trends. To increase rates of walking and biking
   to school will require understanding why many parents choose to drive
   their children to school and how well existing programs, like Safe
   Routes to School, work. Purpose: We aimed to understand why many parents
   choose to drive their children even short distances to school, and what
   implications this has for programs to increase walking and biking to
   school. Methods: We used data from a telephone survey to explore why
   parents drive their children to school. Results and conclusions: We
   found that 75% of parents driving their children less than 2 miles to
   school said they did this for convenience and to save time. Nearly half
   of parents driving their children less than 2 miles did not allow their
   child to walk to school without adult supervision. Accompanying a child
   on a walk to school greatly increases the time the household devotes to
   such a trip. Few Safe Routes to School programs effectively address
   issues of parental convenience and time constraints. Takeaway for
   practice: Safe Routes to School programs should take parental
   convenience and time constraints into account by providing ways children
   can walk to school supervised by someone other than the parent, such as
   by using walking school buses. To be effective, such programs need
   institutional support. Schools should take a multimodal approach to
   pupil transportation. Research support: This research was funded by the
   Active Living Research program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and
   the U.S. and California Departments of Transportation through the
   University of California Transportation Center.

   road safety level on the intersections, the behaviour of the car
   drivers, the behaviour and the safety measures of the bicyclists, the

AB Text offers variety of anthropological perspectives which can be used to
   gain insight. into the culture of motorcycling and motorcyclers
   (particular sport touring bikes). Asking if motorcycling can be
   explained as a sport, art or ritual, the complexity of motorcycling
   phenomena is being shown. Motorcycling as a preferred leisure activity
   is here regarded through the body experience (embodied capital), risk
   taking experience (edgework), naturalness seeking (civilization escape),
   traveling (the road) and finally through bike's qualities such as
   flexibility, mobility and spontaneity. The historical context of
   motorcycling beginnings is briefly described (antihero, rebel without
   reason). Such a theorizing about motorcycling serves us for proving that
   sport touring biking is not subculture in common meaning but rather a
   praxeology- performance based on shared embodied experiencing.

AB Breast cancer exhibits clinical and molecular heterogeneity, where
   expression profiling studies have identified five major molecular
   subtypes. The basal-like subtype, expressing basal epithelial markers
   and negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and
   HER2, is associated with higher overall levels of DNA copy number
   alteration (CNA), specific CNAs bike gain on chromosome 10p), and poor
   prognosis. Discovering the molecular genetic basis of tumor subtypes may
   provide new opportunities for therapy. To identify the driver oncogene
   on 10p associated with basal-like tumors, we analyzed genomic profiles
   of 172 breast carcinomas. The smallest shared region of gain spanned
   just seven genes at 10p13, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent
   protein kinase 1D (CAMK1D), functioning in intracellular signaling but
   not previously linked to cancer. By microarray, CAMK1D was overexpressed
   when amplified, and by immunohistochemistry exhibited elevated
   expression in invasive carcinomas compared to carcinoma in situ.
   Engineered overexpression of CAMK1D in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial
   cells led to increased cell proliferation, and molecular and phenotypic
   alterations indicative of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
   including loss of cell-cell adhesions and increased cell migration and
   invasion. Our findings identify CAMK1D as a novel amplified oncogene
   linked to EMT in breast cancer, and as a potential therapeutic target
   with particular relevance to clinically unfavorable basal-like tumors.

AB Purpose: This study examined factors related to two sources of physical
   activity for youth: active use of recreation sites and active transport
   to recreation sites. Methods: Parents of children (n = 87) and matched
   pairs of parents and adolescents (n = 124 pairs) in three US cities
   reported on Youths' active use of, proximity to, and walking/biking to
   12 recreation sites and on neighborhood walkability and safety.
   Multivariate regression models evaluated factors associated with youths'
   frequent site use and active transport to sites. Results: Proximity to
   the site was associated with frequent use of large parks and public open
   space. Walking/biking to the site was associated with frequent use of
   most sites (indoor recreation sites, small and large parks, basketball
   courts, walking/running tracks, school recreation sites, playgrounds,
   and public open space). After controlling for proximity and demographic
   factors, active transport to sites remained significantly associated (P
   < 0.05) with frequent use of four sites for children (indoor recreation,
   walking/running tracks, school recreation facilities, and public open
   space) and all but three sites for adolescents (indoor recreation,
   playfields/courts, and beach/lake/rivers). Adolescents' active transport
   to more sites was most positively related to higher perceived traffic
   safety and to better pedestrian infrastructure and was negatively
   related to crime threat. Adolescents with driver's licenses walked/biked
   to recreation sites less often. Conclusions: Active transport was
   strongly associated with the use of multiple recreation sites by
   children and adolescents, even when accounting for proximity and
   demographic factors. Adolescents living in neighborhoods with better
   traffic safety walked/biked to more recreation sites for physical
   activity. Findings support the need for built environments and
   transportation policies that facilitate safe, active transport to
   recreation sites for youth physical activity.

   Method. Survey of a representative sample of 1000 inhabitants of the
   city of Graz, Austria, using a computer-assisted telephone interview
   addressing cycling behavior and associated personal, social and
   environmental factors.
   Results. The prevalence of biking for transportation was 22.5%. After
   adjustment for gender, age, education, physical activity level and
   distance from home to destination, cycling was positively associated
   with the presence of bike lane connectivity (OR=2.09) and social
   support/modeling (OR=1.62), and negatively associated with the perceived
   barriers of "physical discomfort" (OR=0.49) and "an impractical
   transport mode" (OR=0.50). Analysis of interactions indicated that the
   effect of the perceived benefit of "rapidity" was stronger in physically
   active persons than inactive individuals, and the effect of the
   perceived barrier of "an impractical mode of transportation" was
   stronger among women than men.
   Conclusion. In addition to cycling-related social support and perceived
   benefits and barriers, bike lane connectivity may be an important
   determinant of cycling as a means of transportation among adult city
   dwellers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   did not hunt or fished in a particular season. The statistical
   significance of correlation coefficient parameter supports the use of a
   joint (e.g., bivariate) rather than separate (e.g., univariate) decision
   modeling process for fishing or hunting share equations. Most individual
   characteristics are statistically significant as explanatory variables.
   Respondents holding recreation licenses tended to spend significantly
   more on recreation than those without licenses. All own-price and
   cross-price elasticities are statistically significant and suggest that
   hunting and fishing are complements. The results also suggest that the
   popularity of hunting may decline as the population ages. (c) 2007

AB In Arlington, Virginia, a steady evolutionary change in biking policy
   during the last three decades has yielded some of the nation's best
   biking assets. It has a comprehensive, well-connected, highly
   integrated, well-mapped, and well-signed system of shared-use paved
   trails, bike lanes, bike routes, and other biking assets, such as
   workplace showers. Understanding the conditions that led to Arlington's
   current biking system can provide lessons in the strategy and tactics of
   active-living politics.
   One potentially effective political strategy that was successful in
   Arlington is for activists to pressure elected officials to select
   professional managers who see bikeways as crucial to the overall
   transportation system. Then it is important to formalize the
   government-citizen relationship through an advisory panel. Also, in
   Arlington, the incremental creation of biking assets helped create
   demand for more and better facilities. In turn, this created political
   support for expanding and upgrading. Finally, Arlington used potentially
   negative circumstances (e. g., the building of highway corridors, the
   introduction of the Metro) as opportunities to change the built
   environment in ways that have encouraged more active living.

   METHODS: A total of Fifty-one bike riders and pillion seat passengers,
   who participated in this study were part of a larger study, involved in
   a road traffic accident and were brought to the accident and emergency
   unit of either the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) or the
   State Specialist Hospital between August 2002-July 2003.The injured ones
   were examined and dead patients had an autopsy done on them
   RESULTS: A total of 51 cases of bikes riders/pillion seat passenger
   accidents were recorded representing 18% of total accidents. 35
   motorbike riders/pillion seat passengers were struck down by cars
   (68.6%). Seven bike riders/pillion seat passengers (13.5%) were struck
   by articulated vehicles. 7 bike riders/pillion seat passengers
   representing 13.5% of cases were stuck by buses, 2 (3.9%) pillion seat
   passengers fell of bikes from epilepsies and sustained secondary
   injuries. Males were more in number with a ratio of 2.5; 1. One hundred
   percent (100%) or all motorcyclist and their passengers did not use

   CONCLUSION: Cars struck down most bike riders and their pillion seat
   passengers. Males were more than females in number. The commonest
   autopsy findings as cause of death was intr a-cranial hemorrhage

AB The presented study provides an insight into gender's role in the field
   of passenger transport. In so doing, women's and men's direct and
   indirect paid working hours necessary to satisfy final demand for
   passenger transport in Germany are analysed in detail. While a fifth of
   all working hours towards transport related services can be assigned to
   female employees, their contributions to corresponding gross value added
   account for one fourth. The difference points to women's higher average
   educational achievements and subsequently higher productivity in the
   field of transport compared to average male employees.
   The second part of this study focuses on gender specific mobility
   patterns. It turns out that men spend more time travelling during a day
   than women. This applies especially for commuting and business trips but
   also holds for trips related to leisure activities. Against, women spend
   more time on trips related to domestic work. A more detailed analysis of
   modal choice shows that men's motorised individual transport clearly
   exceeds women's usage of cars and motorbikes. Contrary, women tend to
   spend more time in public transportation respectively on foot or bike.
   Finally, the gender specific transport performance indicates that in
   spite the higher share of women in the population men's transport
   performance clearly exceeds the women's.

AB Davis, California, has long been known as the bicycle capital of the
   United States. In the 1960s, citizens lobbied for bike lanes to make
   bike travel safer. After 2 years of lobbying and I year of engineering,
   Davis created the first bike lanes in postwar America. After 1967,
   transportation in Davis was oriented toward the bicycle. The city's
   Public Works Department staff developed many innovative designs and
   programs that were fine-tuned in Davis and then exported elsewhere. The
   university and city worked together on engineering, education,
   enforcement, and encouragement efforts. In the 1980s, greenways were
   added to the system. Davis now has 50 mi of bike lanes and 50 mi of
   off-street paths in a 10-square-mi city, making a highly functional
   bicycle transportation system. However, bicycling levels have decreased
   since 1990, failing from 28% of work trips in 1980 to 14% in 2000. City
   and University of California, Davis, staff attribute this to changing
   demographics, intercity commuting, and increased transit. In addition,
   during this time, bicycle programs have contracted and infrastructure
   expansion has slowed. Application of theories of public policy change
   suggest that the advocacy efforts. in the 1960s led to a policy shift
   emphasizing bicycling that continued through the mid-1990s, when most
   programs had dwindled or disappeared. In the future, a resurgence in
   advocacy might reverse the deterioration of bicycle programs and result
   in increased bicycle use by Davis residents.

   empirical perspective, a questionnaire was designed to collect data
   related to perceptions of cycling difficulties and to provide a

   from samples in urban and suburban environments. The Rasch model was
   applied to analyze the cycling abilities of the students as well as
   their perceptions of cycling difficulty. Findings indicate that boys
   have better cycling abilities than girls, urban students have better
   abilities than suburban students, ability parallels age (older students
   have better cycling ability), and parents' attitudes toward cycling to
   school parallel their children's abilities (parents of students with
   better cycling ability are less concerned). Various impediments to
   cycling are identified and, based on students' perceptions, levels of
   difficulty are assigned. Implications of the results are discussed, and
   recommendations are offered, so as to facilitate matching bicycle use

AB According to Aristotle, the most beautiful city is the one that reaches
   harmony, which is the equilibrium between its population and size. This
   is a prerequisite for producing beauty within the city. Nowadays, the
   aforementioned proposal could be interpreted as a wide goal comprising
   contemporary principles aiming at preserving the quality of life, such
   as the protection of the environment, sustainability, sustainable
   development and sustainable mobility.
   In this context, the paper examines sustainable mobility in Larissa, one
   of the major Greek cities in Thessaly. Larissa is a dynamic industrial,
   agricultural and cultural centre in the mainland of Greece with around
   200.000 inhabitants. The first attempt to rationalize urban planning
   according to contemporary principles dates back to the seventies. Since
   that period the city has known a high development rate, while a series
   of plans and studies have been elaborated and implemented aiming at
   sustainable development, urban renaissance and sustainable mobility in
   the city centre. Thus, Larissa disposes of a wide pedestrian network as
   well as a less extended bike network. The above infrastructure connects
   the administrative centre to the traditional / old part of the city and
   finally to the river shores zone. The works in question have improved
   the quality of life and have had a direct positive impact on the
   physiognomy of the city. Therefore, the city could be considered as an
   interesting model case implementing sustainable mobility in Greece.
   The paper presents the evolution and implementation of sustainable
   mobility in Larissa, showing off the institutional framework and taking
   into account the encountered difficulties. Finally, it concludes with
   proposals and perspectives of sustainable mobility and urban transport
   policy for the city in question, which could reveal a particular
   interest for towns of similar scale in the wider European area.

AB BACKGROUND: Features of the built environment that influence physical
   activity behavior characterize Active Community Environments.
   CONTEXT: Whether Active Community Environments policies exist in the
   state of Hawaii's four counties is unknown. The purpose of this study
   was to provide a baseline assessment of these policies in Hawaii.
   METHODS: A survey assessing policies in six domains (i.e., sidewalks,
   bike lanes, greenways, recreational facilities, commercial buildings,
   and shared-use paths) was completed by employees of Hawaii planning
   departments.
   CONSEQUENCES: Honolulu County had the most policies (n = 13), followed
   by Maui County (n = 6), Kauai County (n = 2), and Hawaii County (n = 1).
   Written policies were most prevalent in Honolulu County (n = 15),
   followed by Kauai County (n = 14), Hawaii County, (n = 4), and Maui
   County (n = 3). Sidewalk policies were reported for Honolulu County,
   Maui County (no written policies were found for Maui County), and Kauai
   County. Bike lane and greenway policies were found for Honolulu County
   (reported and written) and Kauai County (written). Recreation facility
   and pedestrian shared-use path policies existed for all counties,
   although only Honolulu and Kauai counties had written policies for
   commercial buildings (Maui County reported having policies). Few
   policies directly addressed physical activity promotion.
   INTERPRETATION: The most populous county, Honolulu, had the most
   policies in place, although discrepancies existed between reported and
   written policies. This baseline measure of physical activity-related
   policies will help focus efforts of county coalitions to increase
   opportunities for physical activity. Additional policies should be
   tracked with population behavior surveillance.

AB Childhood obesity is increasing worldwide, raising alarm about future
   trends of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. This article
   discusses what may underlie our failure to respond effectively to the
   obesity epidemic, and presents a wider perspective for future research
   and public health agendas. So far targeting individual-level
   determinants and clinical aspects of childhood obesity has produced
   limited success. There is growing interest in understanding the wider
   determinants of obesity such as the built environment (e.g.
   walkability), social interactions, food marketing and prices, but much
   needs to be learned. Particularly, we need to identify distal modifiable
   factors with multiple potential that would make them attractive for
   people and policymakers alike. For example, walking-biking-friendly
   cities can reduce obesity as well as energy cosumption, air pollution
   and traffic delays. Such agenda needs to be driven by strong evidence
   from research involving multi-level influences on behaviour, as well as
   the study of wider politico-economic trends affecting people's choices.
   This article highlights available evidence and arguments for research
   and policy needed to curb the obesity epidemic. The upstream approach
   underlying these arguments aims to make healthy choices not only the
   most rational, but also the most feasible and affordable.

AB This article shows how the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany have made
   bicycling a safe, convenient and practical way to get around their
   cities. The analysis relies on national aggregate data as well as case
   studies of large and small cities in each country. The key to achieving
   high levels of cycling appears to be the provision of separate cycling
   facilities along heavily travelled roads and at intersections, combined
   with traffic calming of most residential neighbourhoods. Extensive
   cycling rights of way in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are
   complemented by ample bike parking, full integration with public
   transport, comprehensive traffic education and training of both cyclists
   and motorists, and a wide range of promotional events intended to
   generate enthusiasm and wide public support for cycling. In addition to
   their many pro-bike policies and programmes, the Netherlands, Denmark
   and Germany make driving expensive as well as inconvenient in central
   cities through a host of taxes and restrictions on car ownership, use
   and parking. Moreover, strict land-use policies foster compact,
   mixed-use developments that generate shorter and thus more bikeable
   trips. It is the coordinated implementation of this multi-faceted,
   mutually reinforcing set of policies that best explains the success of
   these three countries in promoting cycling. For comparison, the article
   portrays the marginal status of cycling in the UK and the USA, where
   only about 1% of trips are by bike.

AB This paper investigates how bicycling can be promoted as a safe and
   feasible means of transport for everyone and for all trip purposes. The
   policies and programs needed to encourage a broad spectrum of social
   groups to cycle are the same policies and programs that encourage high
   overall levels of cycling: extensive systems of separate cycling
   facilities, intersection modifications and priority bicycle traffic
   signals, traffic calming of neighborhoods, safe and convenient bike
   parking, coordination and integration of cycling with public transport,
   traffic education and training for both cyclists and motorists, and
   traffic laws that favor cyclists and pedestrians. To show how this
   multifaceted, coordinated approach actually works, the paper focuses on
   cycling trends and policies in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany.
   The national-level comparative analysis is supplemented with case
   studies of large and small cities in each country.

AB Several Chinese cities are interested in incorporating transit-oriented
   development (TOD) around their subway stations. Few cities, however,
   have considered incorporating TOD into their bus systems; fewer still
   have included China's bike population. The midsize Chinese city of
   Jinan, capital of the northeastern province of Shandong, wants to
   incorporate both bus rapid transit (BRT) and TOD within its urban
   planning framework. Jinan is set to construct a 135-km BRT network and
   seeks to incorporate TOD initially at the neighborhood level and
   eventually in the entire city. As part of an ongoing project between the
   University of California Transportation Center and the Transportation
   Engineering Department of Shandong University, preliminary land use
   analysis was conducted on a proposed BRT corridor, Lishan Road,
   incorporating smart-growth principles as a framework for creating
   walkable neighborhoods. Current land-use challenges, both citywide and
   street specific, to making the Lishan Road BRT corridor a true
   transit-oriented development are presented. The main barriers identified
   are as follows: (a) Excessive auto-oriented land uses along the corridor
   result in pedestrian-bike, bike-vehicle, and pedestrian-vehicle
   conflicts, which will increase with the construction of the BRT
   stations; (b) the land-use pattern manifested in 1-km blocks results in
   excessive distances between pedestrian crossings at intersections; (c)
   with superblock land use patterns and a lack of secondary roads,
   accessibility is limited for all modes; and (d) parking is
   inconsistently enforced, and cars are allowed to park on sidewalks,
   creating unwalkable areas and encouraging driving. Policies and
   guidelines that help shift Jinan's planning to more pedestrian-friendly
   designs are presented.

AB In the 2007 Past Presidents' Award paper, the author discusses her Road
   Diet Handbook: Setting Trends for Livable Streets developed under the
   William Barclay Parsons Fellowship program. The handbook assesses
   livability benefits that have not been previously evaluated, including
   improved mobility for all modes of transportation and enhanced street
   character, and provides an overall best practice for the implementation
   of road diets. The handbook advances the state of the practice and
   provides a practical and valuable tool for practitioners.
   A road diet entails converting a four-lane undivided roadway to a
   two-lane roadway plus a two-way left-turn lane by removing a travel lane
   in each direction. The remaining roadway width can be converted to bike
   lanes, on-street parking, or sidewalks. In cities throughout the world,
   roadways have been put on road diets, and these improvements have
   generated benefits for all modes of transportation including transit,
   bicyclists, pedestrians and motorists. These benefits include reduced
   vehicle speeds; improved mobility and access; reduced collisions and
   injuries; and improved livability and quality of life.
   This paper will summarize the findings from research that the author
   conducted for the Road Diet Handbook: Setting Trends for Livable
   Streets. The handbook is intended to become a practitioner's
   comprehensive guide for decision-making on the applicability of road
   diets. It takes the practitioner through planning, analysis, design and
   implementation of road diet projects and includes guidelines for
   identifying and evaluating potential road diet sites, design concepts
   such as typical cross sections and lessons learned from experiences.

   peer goal setting, public posting of the percentage of correct helmet
   use, and shared reinforcers, all of which were implemented by the school
   resource officer, increased afternoon helmet use and afternoon correct
   helmet use in all three schools. Probe data collected a distance from

AB In 2005, 10 million electric bikes were produced in China. Strong
   domestic sales are projected for coming years, raising concerns about
   the sustainability and potential regulation of this fairly new mode.
   Policy makers are wrestling with developing policy on electric bikes
   with little information about who uses them, why they are used, and what
   factors influence electric bike travel. This paper probes these
   questions by surveying electric bike usage in two large Chinese cities,
   Kunming and Shanghai. Demographic comparisons are made between the
   different modes and cities as well as differences in travel patterns.
   Electric bike users are found to travel considerably more than bicycle
   users. Also, most electric bike users would travel by bus if electric
   bikes were unavailable. This suggests that electric bikes are less of a
   transitional mode between human-powered bikes and full-blown automobile
   ownership, and more an affordable, higher quality mobility option to
   public transport. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The number of policy initiatives to promote the use of bike-and-ride, or
   the combined use of bicycle and public transport for one trip, has grown
   considerably over the past decade as part of the search for more
   sustainable transport solutions. This paper discusses the experiences
   with, and impacts of, such initiatives in the Netherlands. The Dutch
   measures to promote bicycle use in access trips have been generally
   successful. A country-wide program to upgrade regular and secure bicycle
   parking at train stations has led to an increase in user satisfaction
   and a growth in bicycles parked at stations. Smaller programs to
   stimulate the combined use of bike-and-bus have resulted in an increase
   in bicycle use, bus use, and share of infrequent bus passengers. Bicycle
   lockers at bus stops are hardly used by bus passengers, due in part to
   the dominance of students among bus users as well as the relatively high
   price of lockers in comparison to the value of bicycles used for access
   trips. Measures to promote the use of the bicycle in egress trips have
   met with more varying results. Projects to introduce leasing bicycles
   for egress trips have failed to attract passengers, for both train and
   bus services. In contrast, the introduction of flexible rental bicycles
   at train stations has resulted in a small reduction in car use, growth
   in train trips, and growth in bicycle use for non-recurrent trips. The
   Dutch experiences suggest some lessons for promoting bike-and-ride in
   countries and cities with a less well-developed bicycle infrastructure.

AB The purpose of this research was to study the behaviour and attitudes of
   young cyclists in different urban environments towards wearing a helmet,
   and possible differences regarding the length of the cycle lanes in the
   surveyed cities. A survey was carried out among 546 schoolchildren, aged
   from 10 to 15 years, at primary schools in three Croatian cities:
   Zagreb, Varazdin and Samobor. A comparison of the cities regarding the
   ownership of bicycles has shown that there are no statistically
   significant differences between the cities, whereas the difference in
   helmet ownership is statistically significant. Attitudes towards wearing
   a helmet are generally more positive in Zagreb and Varazdin, while the
   situation in Samobor, a town with no bike lanes, is just the opposite -
   schoolchildren there have negative attitudes towards wearing helmets.
   Negative attitudes and insufficient knowledge about wearing a protective
   cycle helmet indicates the necessity of developing positive attitudes
   towards wearing a safety helmet among schoolchildren and educating them
   about the means of injury prevention when riding a bicycle.

AB Purpose. This study examines the associations that a neighborhood's
   physical and social environments have with transportation and recreation
   physical activities, with an emphasis on the roles of health risk and
   economic factors.
   Design. It is a cross-sectional study with a hypothesis-testing
   approach.
   Setting. The study was conducted within the city of Seattle, Washington.
   Subjects. The subjects included 438 able-bodied, randomly selected
   adults.
   Measures. Physical activity and sociodemographic data came from a
   telephone survey (34% response rate). Environmental variables were
   measured subjectively as People's Perceptions and objectively using the
   Geographic Information System. Bivariate analyses and the Structural
   Equation Model were used to test the overall theoretic framework and the
   relationships among latent and observed variables.
   Results. Lower-income populations lived in areas with more routine
   destinations and higher densities and were more active for
   transportation than higher-income populations. People with higher health
   risks were less active for both transportation and recreation purposes.
   The social environment-perception of People walking and biking in the
   neighborhood-was more, strongly associated with recreational physical
   activities, while the physical environment was more strongly associated
   with transportation physical activities.
   Conclusion. Further investigation of different subpopulations and
   explicit distinction among different purposes of physical activities are
   needed in future research and interventions. This study is limited to
   urban areas and cross-sectional data.

AB Four years after the introduction of City CarShare in the San Francisco,
   Bay area in California, 29% of carshare members had gotten rid of one or
   more cars, and 4.8% of members' trips and 5.4% of their vehicle miles
   traveled were in carshare vehicles. Matched-pair comparisons with a
   statistical control group suggest that, over time, members have reduced
   total vehicular travel. However, most declines occurred during the first
   1 to 2 years of the program; 3 to 4 years after City CarShare's
   inauguration, earlier declines had leveled off. Because many carshare
   vehicles are small and fuel-efficient but can carry several people, the
   trend in per capita gasoline consumption also is downward. Mindful of
   the cumulative costs of driving, carshare members appear to have become
   more judicious and selective when deciding whether to drive, take public
   transit, walk, bike, or even forgo a trip. Coupled with reduced personal
   car ownership, these factors have given rise to a resourceful form of
   automobility in the San Francisco Bay area.

AB This paper demonstrates that community-based social marketing techniques
   can be successfully used to affect people's transportation awareness and
   behavior, as deployed in Washington State's King County Metro Transit's
   In Motion program. The In Motion approach focuses on neighborhood-based
   outreach instead of a more typical employer-based trip reduction
   program. In addition, In Motion addresses the potential to change any
   trip from drive alone to an alternative mode instead of focusing
   exclusively on commute trips. In Motion provides neighborhood residents
   with incentives to try driving less, raises individual awareness of
   alternative travel options, and helps break the automatic reflex to
   drive for all trips. The program was designed to be easily adapted to
   other neighborhoods with minor modifications in message and materials.
   The program has been completed in four neighborhoods. Program
   participants in each neighborhood report increased transit ridership and
   use of other non-single-occupant vehicle modes, such as carpooling,
   biking, and walking. The pre- and postparticipant reported mode shares
   for each In Motion program indicate a 24% to > 50% decrease in driving
   alone and a 20% to almost 50% increase in transit use. These
   self-reported numbers are supported by bus stop counts and analysis of
   overall transit ridership. The In Motion program has had promising
   results in urban and suburban neighborhoods and has been positively
   received by residents and businesses. King County Metro Transit
   continues to expand the program to new geographic areas in King County
   and to explore innovative approaches to establish partnerships and
   leverage funding for expanded applications.

   and MMNL2) with different restriction condition were established to
   model traffic mode split of a certain area, and the results indicats
   that MMNL2 is more fitable to explain the original data and more
   reasonable to describe uniform preference factors such as travel time.
   The sensitivity of the mixed logit model to transit travel time factor
   was also discussed in the paper, and the results shows that the
   implementation of bus priority policy make the passenger flow share of

   Furthermore, mixed logit model is more reasonable to model traffic mode
   split due to its reasonable to describe uniform preference factors and

AB Cycling in Zagreb, as means of urban transport inside and outside the
   city, has a bright past, hazy presence but a promising future. Every
   day, aggressive citizens who lack urban traffic culture mistreat many
   cyclists but also many pedestrians. Sedentary way of living, unhealthy
   eating habits and inadequate recreation would surely be reduced if
   Zagreb had a network of cycling tracks (190 cm) or lanes (80 cm). Main
   city roads were constructed at the beginning of the 20th century. Today,
   the lack of cycling tracks is particularly evident in terms of missing
   connections between northern and southern parts of the city.
   Transportation of bikes in public vehicles, parking of bikes as well as
   cycling along the foot of the mountains Medvednica and Zumberacko gorje
   is not adequately organized. Better organization is necessary not only
   because of the present young generation but also because of the young
   who will shortly become citizens of the EU, where cycling is enormously
   popular. Cycling tourism is not known in Zagreb, partly due to
   inadequate roads. The surroundings of Zagreb are more suitable for
   cycling tourism and attractive brochures and tourist guides offer
   information to tourists on bikes. Professional, acrobatic and sports
   cycling do not have a tradition in Zagreb and in Croatia. The same holds
   true for recreational cycling and indoor exercise cycling. The authors
   discuss the impact of popularization of cycling using print and
   electronic media. The role of district and local self-government in the
   construction and improvement of traffic roads in Zagreb is very
   important. It is also significant for the implementation of legal
   regulations that must be obeyed by all traffic participants in order to
   protect cyclists, the most vulnerable group of traffic participants
   besides passengers. Multidisciplinary action of all benevolent experts
   would surely increase safety and pleasure of cycling in the city and its
   surroundings. This would also help reduce daily stress and improve the
   quality of living in the capital of Croatia.

AB This paper presents a novel way of using real-time heart rate
   information to control a physically interactive biathlon (skiing and
   shooting) computer game. Instead of interfacing the game to an exercise
   bike or other equipment with speed output, the skiing speed is directly
   proportional to heart rate. You can freely choose the form of physical
   exercise, which makes it easier for people with different skill levels
   and backgrounds to play together. The system can be used with any
   exercise machine or form. To make playing meaningful instead of simply
   exercising as hard as you can, a high heart rate impedes the shooting
   part of the game by making the sight less steady. This balancing
   mechanism lets the player try out different tactics, varying from very
   slow skiing and sharp shooting to fast skiing and random shooting. The
   game has been evaluated in a user study with eight participants. The
   results show that heart rate interaction is fun and usable interaction
   method.

AB The objective of this work(1) is to automatically generate a large
   number of images for a specified object class (for example, penguin). A
   multi-modal approach employing both text, meta data and visual features
   is used to gather many, high-quality images from the web.
   Candidate images are obtained by a text based web search querying on the
   object identifier (the word penguin). The web pages and the images they
   contain are down-loaded The task is then to remove irrelevant images and
   re-rank the remainder First, the images are re-ranked using a Bayes
   posterior estimator trained on the text surrounding the image and meta
   data features (such as the image alternative tag, image title tag, and
   image filename). No visual information is used at this stage. Second,
   the top-ranked images are used as (noisy) training data and a SVM visual
   classifier is learnt to improve the ranking further The principal
   novelty is in combining text/meta-data and visual features in order to
   achieve a completely automatic ranking of the images.
   Examples are given for a selection of animals (e.g. camels, sharks,
   penguins), vehicles (cars, airplanes, bikes) and other classes (guitar
   wristwatch), totalling 18 classes. The results are assessed by
   precision/recall curves on ground truth annotated data and by comparison
   to previous approaches including those of Berg et al. [5] (on an
   additional six classes) and Fergus et al. [9].

AB Despite rapid economic growth in China during the past decade and the
   rise in personal car ownership, most Chinese still rely on two-wheeled
   vehicles (2WVs) or public transport for commuting. The majority of these
   2WVs are bicycles. In recent years, concern about poor air quality in
   urban areas and rising energy costs have caused cities to ban
   gasoline-powered scooters in city centers. Simultaneously, a new 2WV
   mode emerged to fill the void: the electric bike (e-bike). This shift to
   e-bikes is occurring rapidly throughout China, especially in its cities.
   E-bike sales reached 10 million per year in 2005 as more bike and public
   transit users shifted to this mode. City planners and policy makers are
   undecided on how to plan for and regulate e-bikes because it is not yet
   clear what effect they will have on travel behavior, public
   transportation use, and safety. To begin to understand these effects,
   bike and e-bike users were surveyed in Shijiazhuang, a medium-size city
   with particularly high 2WV use, to identify differences in travel
   characteristics and attitudes. The following conclusions were reached
   (partial list): (a) e-bikes are enabling people to commute longer
   distances, with important implications for energy use, accessibility,
   and urban expansion of cities; (b) people underserved by public
   transportation are shifting to e-bikes; and (c) women feel safer
   crossing intersections on an e-bike compared with a regular bike, but
   they have strong reservations about increasing e-bike speed capability.

AB Urban planning, also called city and regional planning, is a
   multidisciplinary field in which professionals work to improve the
   welfare of persons and communities by creating more convenient,
   equitable, healthful, efficient, and attractive places now and for the
   future. The centerpiece of urban planning activities is a "master plan,"
   which can take many forms, including comprehensive plans, neighborhood
   plans, community action plans, regulatory and incentive strategies,
   economic development plans, and disaster preparedness plans.
   Traditionally, these plans include assessing and planning for community
   needs in some or all of the following areas: transportation, housing,
   commercial/office buildings, natural resource utilization, environmental
   protection, and health-care infrastructure. Urban planning and public
   health share common missions and perspectives. Both aim to improve human
   well-being, emphasize needs assessment and service delivery, manage
   complex social systems, focus at the population level, and rely on
   community-based participatory methods. Both fields focus on the needs of
   vulnerable populations. Throughout their development, both fields have
   broadened their perspectives. Initially, public health most often used a
   biomedical model (examining normal/abnormal functioning of the human
   organism), and urban planning often relied on a geographic model
   (analysis of human needs or interactions in a spatial context). However,
   both fields have expanded their tools and perspectives, in part because
   of the influence of the other. Urban planning and public health have
   been intertwined for most of their histories. In 1854, British physician
   John Snow used geographic mapping of an outbreak of cholera in London to
   identify a public water pump as the outbreak's source. Geographic
   analysis is a key planning tool shared by urban planning and public
   health. In the mid-1800s, planners such as Frederick Law Olmsted bridged
   the gap between the fields by advancing the concept that community
   design contributes to physical and mental health; serving as President
   Lincoln's U.S. Sanitary Commission Secretary; and designing hundreds of
   places, including New York's Central Park. By 1872, the disciplines were
   so aligned that two of the seven founders of the American Public Health
   Association were urban designers (an architect and a housing
   specialist). In 1926, the U.S. Supreme Court, in validating zoning and
   land-use law as a legal government authority in Village of Euclid v.
   Ambler Realty, cited the protection of public health as part of its
   justification. Other connections have included 1) pioneering urbanist
   Jane Jacobs, who during the 1960s, called for community design that
   offered safe and convenient options for walking, biking, and impromptu
   social interaction; and 2) the Healthy Cities movement, which began in
   Europe and the United States during the 1980s and now includes projects
   in approximately 1,000 cities that in various ways highlight the role of
   health as much more than the presence of medical care.

AB Purpose : To describe the degrees of muscle-glycogen depletion and
   resynthesis in response to a half Ironman triathlon. Methods: One male
   subject (38 years of age) completed the Grand Columbian half Ironman
   triathlon ( 1.9-km swim, 90-km bike, 21.1-km run, Coulee City, Wash).
   Three muscle biopsies were obtained from his right vastus lateralis
   (prerace, immediately postrace, and 4 hours postrace). Prerace and
   postrace body weight were recorded, in addition to macronutrient
   consumption before, during, and after the race. Energy expenditure and
   whole-body substrate oxidation were estimated from linear regression
   established from laboratory trials (watts and run pace relative to VO(2)
   and VCO(2)). Results: Body weight decreased 3.8 kg from prerace to
   postrace. Estimated CHO energy expenditure was 10,003 kJ for the bike
   segment and 5759 kJ for the run segment of the race. The athlete
   consumed 308 g of exogenous CHO (liquid and gel; 1.21 g CHO/min) during
   the race. Muscle glycogen decreased from 227.1 prerace to 38.6 mmol . kg
   wet weight(-1) . h(-1) postrace. During the 4 hours postrace, the
   athlete consumed a mixed diet (471 g CHO, 15 g fat, 64 g protein), which
   included liquid CHO sources and a meal. The calculated rate of
   muscle-glycogen resynthesis was 4.1 mmol . kg wet weight(-1) . h(-1).
   Conclusion: Completing a half Ironman triathlon depends on a high rate
   of muscle glycogenolysis, which demonstrates the importance of exogenous
   carbohydrate intake during the race. In addition, rates of
   muscle-glycogen resynthesis might be dampened by the eccentric damage
   resulting from the run portion of the race.

AB Out of more than two thousand bike messengers in New York City, a few
   hundred participate in alleycats-illegal races held in open traffic.
   Surrounding this racing scene is a vibrant messenger community.
   Messengers who race in or attend alleycats carry their messenger
   identity into all aspects of their lives. Through direct participant
   observation, this article proposes that alleycats function as
   Durkheimian rituals for these messengers. Alleycats express the central
   values of the social world. Lost in collective effervescence, the
   individual confronts these values as objectified truths, which allow
   messengers to form stable identities. Further, bicycles, messenger bags,
   and other objects become sacred symbols within this ritualization
   process. The ability of messengers to construct such nonreflexive
   identities is juxtaposed with theories about the self in postmodernity.

AB Private vehicle travel has conferred enormous benefits on many millions
   of drivers and their passengers, but its rise to dominance has also
   imposed significant social and environmental costs on society. This has
   caused a profound ambivalence among many planners over the proper role
   for automobiles in society, particularly in cities. The results are
   plans and policies that aim both to facilitate automobile use and to
   encourage travel by other means, in all cases shielding travelers from
   paying, or even perceiving, the true cost of their travel. But
   off-the-shelf technologies now make it easy to price many transportation
   modes at close to marginal social cost, a change that would improve
   traffic flow, reduce emissions, and increase walking, biking,
   carpooling, and transit use in cities. While the political obstacles to
   better transportation pricing remain daunting, planners today have real
   opportunities to begin weaving transportation pricing into planning
   practice.

AB Over the past forty years various changes in the U. S. "built
   environment" have promoted sedentary lifestyles and less healthful
   diets. James Sallis and Karen Glanz investigate whether these changes
   have had a direct effect on childhood obesity and whether improvements
   to encourage more physical activity and more healthful diets are likely
   to lower rates of childhood obesity.
   Researchers, say Sallis and Glanz, have found many links between the
   built environment and children's physical activity, but they have yet to
   find conclusive evidence that aspects of the built environment promote
   obesity. For example, certain development patterns, such as a lack of
   sidewalks, long distances to schools, and the need to cross busy
   streets, discourage walking and biking to school. Eliminating such
   barriers can increase rates of active commuting. But researchers cannot
   yet prove that more active commuting would reduce rates of obesity.
   Sallis and Glanz note that recent changes in the nutrition environment,
   including greater reliance on convenience foods and fast foods, a lack
   of access to fruits and vegetables, and expanding portion sizes, are
   also widely believed to contribute to the epidemic of childhood obesity.
   But again, conclusive evidence that changes in the nutrition environment
   will reduce rates of obesity does not yet exist.
   Research into the link between the built environment and childhood
   obesity is still in its infancy. Analysts do not know whether changes in
   the built environment have increased rates of obesity or whether
   improvements to the built environment will decrease them. Nevertheless,
   say Sallis and Glanz, the policy implications are clear. People who have
   access to safe places to be active, neighborhoods that are walkable, and
   local markets that offer healthful food are likely to be more active and
   to eat more healthful food-two types of behavior that can lead to good
   health and may help avoid obesity.

AB This paper proposes a new approach to learning a discriminative model of
   object classes, incorporating appearance, shape and context information
   efficiently. The learned model is used for automatic visual recognition
   and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model
   exploits novel features, based on textons, which jointly model shape and
   texture. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using
   shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to
   a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by
   incorporating these classifiers in a conditional random field. Efficient
   training of the model on very large datasets is achieved by exploiting
   both random feature selection and piecewise training methods.
   High classification and segmentation accuracy are demonstrated on three
   different databases: i) our own 21-object class database of photographs
   of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and
   viewpoints, ii) the 7-class Corel subset and iii) the 7-class Sowerby
   database used in [1]. The proposed algorithm gives competitive results
   both for highly textured (e.g. grass, trees), highly structured (e.g.
   cars, faces, bikes, aeroplanes) and articulated objects (e.g. body,
   cow).

AB With mounting concern about current social and environmental challenges,
   the notion of sustainable development-a paradigm calling for the
   integration of economic, social, and environmental goals-has gained
   increasing popularity in recent years. Within the transportation arena,
   sustainability advocates have argued for reducing reliance on the
   private automobile and seeking instead to foster alternative modes such
   as transit, biking, and walking; and many cities are actively pursuing
   this goal. Yet even the most concerted local efforts can be undermined
   by contradictory policy frameworks at higher levels of government, and a
   recent proposal for transportation finance reform in California serves
   as a good case in point. Intended to enhance the reliability of highway
   revenues, the proposal would eliminate a 5% sales tax on gasoline and
   replace it with a 0.25% increase in the general sales tax specifically
   earmarked for transportation. Basic economic analysis shows clearly,
   however, that eliminating the sales tax on gasoline would stimulate
   additional miles driven within the state, leading in turn to increased
   highway congestion and vehicle emissions. At the same time, increasing
   the general sales tax would shift a greater financial burden onto the
   shoulders of nondrivers from lower-income groups. In short, the recent
   California proposal, if enacted, would work counter to the three goals
   of sustainability-economic efficiency, social equity, and environmental
   responsibility-and surely frustrate local efforts to reduce reliance on
   the automobile.

AB This paper brings the debate on sustainable transport policy into direct
   confrontation with the embodied Practice of cycling in a highly
   urbanized environment. Using the example of a regular journey to work
   the author undertook in Birmingham, UK during the summer of 2003, Lees'
   notion of a more performative approach to understanding architecture is
   extended to a performance of the wider city. Tracing in detail the
   practice of this journey, the paper uses the notion of affect to
   highlight the sheer physicality of the bike ride and bow the city is
   thus remade through the cyclist's experiences. This Performative
   understanding is contrasted with more traditional understandings of the
   city, illustrating bow the two reinforce each other. Ultimately the
   question is posed of whether the thrills and chills of urban cycling in
   the UK will leave it as a marginalized transport mode for the
   foreseeable future, despite noises from policy makers about using
   cycling to solve problems of urban congestion and sustainability.

AB Purpose: To examine relationships between selected sociodemographic,
   health-related and environmental factors and levels of physical activity
   in older adults across three age groups. Methods: Seven hundred
   sixty-four older adults (mean age = 77.4 +/- 8.6 yr) from a midsize
   Canadian city completed a self-administered questionnaire under
   researcher supervision. Level of physical activity was determined using
   the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). Correlates of
   physical activity were examined using previously validated
   questionnaires. The findings pertaining to personal and environmental
   factors are presented. Results: Overall, significantly higher mean PASE
   scores were seen in those individuals in the following categories: male
   (P < 0.001), married or common-law (P < 0.001), not living alone (P <
   0.001), not living in senior's housing (P < 0.001), higher levels of
   education (P < 0.001) and higher incomes (P < 0.001). Better physical
   health showed significant positive associations (P < 0.001) with PASE
   score. Individuals reporting at least four or more chronic health
   conditions had significantly lower PASE scores than those reporting no
   chronic conditions (P < 0.001). Significantly lower PASE scores were
   also reported in those using domestic services (P < 0.001). Higher PASE
   scores were related to the presence of hills, biking and walking trails,
   street lights, various recreation facilities, seeing others active and
   unattended dogs (P < 0.001 to P < 0.05). Conclusion: An understanding of
   the factors that influence physical activity behavior in older adults is
   critical to developing effective intervention strategies that will
   address the problem of physical inactivity in this population, and in
   doing so, improve the health status and quality of life of the older
   adult, while having a significant impact on healthcare expenditures.

AB Aims: To investigate the relationship of different patterns of alcohol
   intake to various types of trauma. Methods: We examined the associations
   of alcohol consumption in a series of 385 consecutive trauma admissions
   (278 men, 107 women, age range 16-49 years). Patients underwent clinical
   examinations, structured interviews on the amount and pattern of alcohol
   intake, and measurements of blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Results:
   On admission, 51% of the patients had alcohol in their blood. Binge
   drinking was the predominant (78%) drinking pattern of alcohol intake.
   Assaults, falls and biking accidents were the most frequent causes of
   trauma. Dependent alcohol drinking and binge drinking were found to be
   significantly more common among patients with head trauma than in those
   with other types of trauma (77% vs 59%, OR = 2.38; 95% CI 1.50 to 3.77).
   The OR for sustaining head injury increased sharply with increasing BAC:
   1-99 mg/dl (1.24; 95% CI 0.55-2.01), 100-149 mg/dl 1.64; 95% CI
   0.71-3.77), 150-199 mg/dl (3.20; 95% CI 1.57-6.53) and > 199 mg/dl
   (9.23; 95% CI 4.79-17.79). Conclusions: Binge drinking is a major risk
   factor for head trauma among trauma patients. Assaults, falls and biking
   accidents are the commonest causes for such injuries. The relative risk
   for head injury markedly increases with increasing blood alcohol levels.
   Alcohol control measures should feature in policies aiming at the
   prevention of trauma-related morbidity and mortality.

AB From a public health perspective, a cost-benefit analysis of using
   bike/pedestrian trails in Lincoln, Nebraska, to reduce health care costs
   associated with inactivity was conducted. Data was obtained from the
   city's 1998 Recreational Trails Census Report and the literature. Per
   capita annual cost of using the trails was 209.28 U.S. dollars (59.28
   U.S. dollars construction and maintenance, 150 U.S. dollars of equipment
   and travel). Per capita annual direct medical benefit of using the
   trails was 564.41 U.S. dollars. The cost-benefit ratio was 2.94, which
   means that every 1 U.S. dollar investment in trails for physical
   activity led to 2.94 U.S. dollars in direct medical benefit. The
   sensitivity analyses indicated the ratios ranged from 1.65 to 13.40.
   Therefore, building trails is cost beneficial from a public health
   perspective. The most sensitive parameter affecting the cost-benefit
   ratios were equipment and travel costs; however, even for the highest
   cost, every 1 U.S. dollar investment in trails resulted in a greater
   return in direct medical benefit.

AB This paper describes how the use of bicycle helmets in Sweden has
   changed for different categories of cyclists from 1988 to 2002, and it
   also estimates future trends in voluntary wearing of bicycle helmets up
   to the year 2010. Observational studies of the use of bicycle helmets
   were conducted once a year from 1988 to 2002 at 157 sites in 21 cities.
   The subjects observed were children cycling to school (average n =
   5471/year) and in their free time (average n = 2191/year), and adults
   cycling to workplaces and on public bike paths (average n = 29
   368/year). The general trend in helmet use from 1988 to 2002 was
   determined by linear regression analysis, and the results were also
   employed to estimate future helmet wearing for the period 2003-2010.
   Differences in helmet use according to gender and size of city were
   analysed by chi-square tests. From 1988 to 2002, all categories of
   cyclists showed an upward trend in helmet use (p < 0.01, p < 0.001).
   Helmet wearing increased from about 20 to 35% among children (less than
   or equal to10 years) cycling during free time, from approximately 5 to
   33% among school children, and from around 2 to 14% in adults. Total
   average helmet use rose from about 4 to 17%. However, during the last 5
   years of the study period (1998-2002), none of the categories of
   cyclists studied showed an upward trend in helmet wearing. It is
   estimated that similar to30% of cyclists will wear helmets voluntarily
   by the year 2010, if helmet promotion activities are continued at the
   same level as previously. The results suggest that Sweden will probably
   not reach its official goal of 80% helmet use unless a national bicycle
   helmet law is passed.

AB Background: Enhancing community environments to support walking and
   bicycling serves as a promising approach to increase population levels
   of physical activity. However, few studies have simultaneously assessed
   perceptions and objectively measured environmental factors and their
   relative association with transportation or recreational physical
   activity.
   Methods: For this cross-sectional study, high- and low-income study
   areas were selected among census tracts in St. Louis MO ("low-walkable"
   city) and Savannah GA ("high-walkable" city). Between February and June
   2002, a telephone survey of 1068 adults provided measures of the
   perceived environment and physical activity behavior. In this timeframe,
   objective measures were collected through environmental audits of all
   street segments (n = 1158). These measures were summarized using 400-m
   buffers surrounding each respondent. Neighborhood characteristics
   included the land use environment, transportation environment,
   recreational facilities, aesthetics, and social environment.
   Associations were examined between neighborhood features and
   transportation- and recreation-based activity.
   Results: After adjusting for age, gender, and education, transportation
   activity was negatively associated with objective measures of sidewalk
   levelness and perceived and objective neighborhood aesthetics. It was
   positively associated with perceived and objectively measured number of
   destinations and public transit, perceived access to bike lanes, and
   objective counts of active people in the neighborhood. Recreational
   activity was positively associated with perceived access to recreational
   facilities and objective measures of attractive features.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that physical activities for
   transportation or recreational are associated with different perceived
   and objective environmental characteristics. Modifications to these
   features may change the physical activity behavior of residents exposed
   to them.

AB Despite the advanced age of many patients having total knee
   arthroplasty, previous attempts to quantify patient function
   postoperatively have not allowed for normal deterioration of
   musculoskeletal function that occurs with aging. We determined the
   effects of aging on knee function, thereby providing a realistic level
   of normal, healthy knee function for patients and surgeons after total
   knee arthroplasties. A self-administered, validated knee function
   questionnaire consisting of 55 scaled multiple choice questions was used
   in this study. Responses were collected from 243 patients at least I
   year after they had total knee arthroplasties, and from 257 individuals
   (age- and gender-matched) who had no previous history of knee disorders.
   Many of these latter subjects reported that they could do most of the
   activities cited in the questionnaire without symptoms attributable to
   their knees. However, knee symptoms were experienced more frequently
   during activities that placed greater loads on the extremity. There was
   no difference in the knee function of men and women, and both groups had
   continuous deterioration in knee function with increasing age. There
   were large differences in the functional capacity to do activities
   involving the knee between the group of patients who had total knee
   arthroplasties and the age- and gender-matched patients with no previous
   knee disorders. Overall, 52% of the patients who had total knee
   arthroplasties reported some degree of limitation in doing functional
   activities, versus 22% of subjects with no previous knee disorders. Two
   groups of activities were identified: activities in which the patients
   and control subjects had essentially similar knee function (swimming,
   golfing, and stationary biking), and activities in which the function
   scores of the control group exceeded the scores of the patients who had
   total knee arthroplasties (kneeling, squatting, moving laterally,
   turning and cutting, carrying loads, stretching, leg strengthening,
   tennis, dancing, gardening, and sexual activity). Our data show that
   many of the limitations reported by patients after total knee
   arthroplasties are shared by individuals with no previous knee
   disorders. However, only approximately 40% of the functional deficit
   present after a total knee arthroplasty seems to be attributable to the
   normal physiologic effects of aging. Patients who had total knee
   replacements still experienced substantial functional impairment
   compared with their age- and gender-matched peers, especially when doing
   biomechanically demanding activities. This suggests that significant
   improvements in the procedure and prosthetic designs are needed to
   restore normal knee function after a total knee arthroplasty.

AB How do people recognize metaphors? In nominal metaphors, such as "My
   lawyer is a shark," the metaphor vehicle "shark" refers to an abstract
   category of predatory creatures, not to the basic-level concept, the
   literal fish we call "shark." People can use the level of abstraction of
   the metaphor vehicle (shark) as a cue that the expression is intended
   metaphorically rather than literally (Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990). Can
   the metaphorical use of verbs, as in "he hopped on his bike and flew
   home" be recognized in the same way? We investigated whether the level
   of abstraction of a verb's referent provides a cue that the verb is used
   metaphorically rather than literally. We varied level of abstraction of
   verb use, and obtained judgments of metaphoricity as a function of
   abstraction level. As with nouns, verbs that are understood at a higher
   level of abstraction are rated as more metaphorical than when the same
   verbs could be interpreted at the basic (literal) level. Furthermore,
   this effect is graded: the higher the level of abstraction, the higher
   the rated metaphoricity. These findings suggest that people use level of
   abstraction as a cue to metaphoricity for both nominal and predicative
   metaphors.

AB Bike-and-ride, or the combined use of bicycle and public transport for
   one trip, is a multimodal alternative for the car. This paper discusses
   the use of bike-and-ride in three countries with widely differing
   bicycle cultures and infrastructures: the Netherlands, Germany and the
   UK. The share of the bicycle in access trips is comparable to general
   levels of bicycle ridership in each country, but only for train services
   and other fast modes of public transport. Strong similarities are found
   in the characteristics of bike-and-ride trips and users, in terms of
   travel distances, travel motives, and the impact of car availability.
   The majority of bike-and-ride users travels between 2 and 5 km to a
   public transport stop, with longer access distances reported for faster
   modes of public transport. Work and education are the main travel
   motives, with the first dominating the faster modes and the second the
   slower modes of public transport. Car availability hardly influences the
   choice for a combined use of bicycle and train, but strongly affects the
   levels of bike-and-ride for slower modes of transport. (C) 2004 Elsevier

AB We present an analysis of a mountain bike front shock failure. The
   failure of the 1-year-old shock occurred catastrophically as the bike
   was ridden off of a 1-m drop. The failure was the result of fast
   fracture through both shock tubes at the location where the tubes were
   press fit into the shock upper crown. Examination of the fracture
   surfaces of the tubes revealed regions of fatigue crack growth that
   nearly penetrated the entire thickness of both tubes. An estimate of the
   forces during use, coupled with stress analysis, revealed three stresses
   near the fracture site-axial compression, bending, and hoop stresses.
   During operation, the axial compressive stress is negligible while the
   hoop and bending stresses are significant. Based on fracture mechanics,
   and an estimate of the bending stress from a 1-m drop, it is confirmed
   that the fatigue cracks present on the fracture surface were large
   enough to induce fast fracture. Prior to the existence of the fatigue
   cracks, the stresses were magnified locally near the fracture site by a
   significant stress concentration caused by the sharp transition from the
   shock tube to the crown. The fatigue cracks initiated at a
   circumferential location in the tube commensurate with high tensile
   bending stress and the stiffest region of the crown (highest stress
   concentration). Based on the evidence, the most probable cause of the
   bike shock fatigue failure was the shock design, which facilitated high
   local stresses during use. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We estimated the annual cost of bike and pedestrian trails in Lincoln,
   Neb, using construction and maintenance costs provided by the Department
   of Parks and Recreation of Nebraska. We obtained the number of users of
   5 trails from a 1998 census report. The annual construction cost of each
   trail was calculated by using 3%, 5%, and 10% discount rates for a
   period of useful life of 10, 30, and 50 years. The average cost per mile
   and per user was calculated.
   Trail length averaged 3.6 miles (range= 1.6-4.6 miles). Annual cost in
   2002 dollars ranged from $25 762 to $248479 (mean=$124927; median=
   $171064). The cost per mile ranged from $5735 to $54017 (mean=$35355;
   median=$37994). The annual cost per user was $235 (range= $83-$592),
   whereas per capita annual medical cost of inactivity was $622.
   Construction of trails fits a wide range of budgets and may be a viable
   health amenity for most communities. To increase trail
   cost-effectiveness, efforts to decrease cost and increase the number of
   users should be considered.

AB The municipality of Motala in Sweden introduced a local bicycle helmet
   'law' on May 1, 1996. This is not a legally enacted ordinance, but
   instead a legislated recommendation backed up by information and
   education. Formally, the law applies to children (aged 6-12 years),
   although the intention is to increase helmet use by all cyclists. The
   objective of the present study was to quantitatively evaluate the impact
   of the Motala helmet law on observed use of helmets by children and
   adults. Bicycle helmet use was monitored in Motala (n = 2,458/year) and
   in control towns (n = 17,818/year) both before and after adoption of the
   helmet law (1995-1998). Chi-square tests showed that helmet wearing
   1995-1998 increased in Motala among all bicyclists (from 6.1% to 10.5%)
   and adults biking on cycle paths (from 1.8% to 7.6%). Helmet use by
   school children aged 6-12 increased during the first 6 months after
   introduction of the law (from 65.0% to 75.7%) but then progressively
   decreased to the pre-law level. Considering children cycling on cycle
   paths and for recreation in housing areas, there was a tendency towards
   increased helmet use during the first post-law year, but this was
   followed by a reduction to a lower level in 1998 than in 1995. Logistic
   regression analysis taking into account data from the control towns
   indicated that the helmet law had a positive effect on children cycling
   to schools during the first 6 months, and a weak delayed but more
   long-term positive effect on adult cyclists on cycle paths. There were
   no positive effects on children in housing areas and on cycle paths. The
   Motala helmet law probably would have had greater and more lasting
   effects on helmet use by bicyclists, if certain problems had been
   avoided during the initiation phase. Moreover, although it did have a
   positive influence on both school children and adults, it is not legally
   binding, and hence no penalties can be imposed. Presumably, compulsory
   legislation would have a more substantial impact on helmet wearing than
   a non-mandatory helmet 'law' such as that introduced in Motala.

AB Findings are presented from a study of land use, parking, mode choice,
   and housing and jobs development in downtown Berkeley, California, a
   medium-sized city with 4 decades of experience with parking management
   and transit-oriented development. The multiple roles that parking
   management, including reduced parking requirements and parking pricing,
   can play in a downtown area are explored, as is the performance of
   transit-oriented development in smaller cities. Originally developed as
   a streetcar suburb, Berkeley has long supported high-quality transit,
   restricted parking, and walking and biking facilities. These practices
   have resulted in transit, walk, and bike usage far higher than U.S.
   averages. Nevertheless, in downtown Berkeley, traffic is heavy, parking
   is full, and concerns about infill development persist. Merchants are
   also concerned that parking constraints may limit economic development.
   Surveys of downtown shoppers, workers, and residents show that
   relatively few drive downtown. Workers and downtown residents make up a
   large share of downtown commercial enterprises' customers. Residents
   have intentionally chosen to live in a transit- and pedestrian-friendly
   area and own and use cars far less often than average. Parking shortages
   are caused in large part by overtime parking, facilitated by broken
   meters and by meter feeding by employees. Overall, transit-oriented
   development has been successful in reducing auto ownership and use, but
   it is accompanied by tight parking and a certain amount of congestion.
   Parking enforcement and better use of off-street spaces would relieve
   the former problem.

AB Trail development and use continues to expand nationwide, following the
   1986 predictions of the Presidents Commission on Americans Outdoors.
   This expansion sparks new conflicts and exacerbates old ones. The
   nation's state park systems are leaders in developing new recreation
   opportunities (e.g. mountain biking) while continuing to provide for
   traditional activities such as hiking. This makes state parks primary
   sites to study trail-related conflicts and their resolution. The
   authors, in cooperation with the National Association of State Park
   Directors, administered a mail questionnaire to the nation's 50 state
   park directors in July and August 2003 about state park trail conflict
   and resolution strategies. Of the 50 states, 32 responded. The mean
   state park system provided about 923 trail miles, with 62% for
   non-motorized use only, 33% shared nonmotorized/motorized use and 5%
   motorized use only. Of the five types of conflicts studied (among or
   between trail users, between trail users and other recreationists,
   between trail users and adjacent private owners, within a trail use
   activity or with non-recreation land users and uses), conflicts among or
   between trail users were rated as the most serious by a majority of
   respondents who identified a most serious conflict. In particular,
   conflicts among motorized and non-motorized uses and between motorized
   uses were rated as the most serious. Management responses included
   signage promoting appropriate trail etiquette, seasonal restrictions on
   one or more uses, motorized safety patrols on shared use trails,
   ticketing illegal motorized use on non-motorized trails, physical
   barriers to motorized vehicles and creation of separate trails for
   conflicting uses.

AB The Department of Transportation of the city of Charlotte, North

   features that affect pedestrians and bicyclists crossing signalized
   intersections. Referred to as level of service, this methodology
   identifies and evaluates features according to their influence on the
   comfort and safety of pedestrians and bicyclists. Among the key features
   identified and rated are crossing distance, roadway space allocation
   (i.e., crosswalks, bike lanes), corner radius dimension, and traffic
   signal characteristics. This methodology can be used as a diagnostic
   tool to assess and improve pedestrian and bicyclist levels of comfort
   and safety by modifying design and operational features of
   intersections. Results can be compared with those for traffic levels of
   service of an intersection and weighed according to user priorities.
   This methodology will be included in Charlotte's new street design
   guidelines and will be used to select design and operational features
   that can help achieve desired levels of service for pedestrians and

   factors used in these instruments. It synthesizes the current state of
   knowledge in quantifying the built environment. The paper provides
   health promotion professionals an understanding of the essential aspects
   of environments influencing walking and bicycling for both recreational
   and transportation purposes. It serves as a basis to develop valid and
   efficient tools to create activity-friendly communities.
   Data Sources. Keyword searches identified journal articles from the
   computer-based, Academic Citation Databases, including the National
   Transportation Library, the Web of Science Citation Database, and
   MEDLINE. Governmental publications and conference proceedings were also
   searched.
   Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. All instruments to audit
   physical environments have been included in this review, considering
   both recreation- and transportation-related walking and bicycling.
   Excluded are general methods devised to estimate walking and cycling
   trips, those used in empirical studies on land use and transportation,
   and research on walking inside buildings.
   Data Extraction Methods. Data have been extracted from each instrument
   using a template of key items developed for this review. The data were
   examined for quality assurance among three experienced researchers.
   Data Synthesis. A behavioral model of the built environment guides the
   synthesis according to three components: the origin and destination of
   the walk or bike trip, the characteristics of the road traveled, and the
   characteristics of the areas surrounding the trip's origin and
   destination, These components, combined with the characteristics of the
   instruments themselves, lead to a classification of the instruments into
   the four categories of inventory, route quality assessment, area quality
   assessment, and approaches to estimating latent demand for walking and
   bicycling. Furthermore, individual variables used in each instrument to
   measure the environment are grouped into four classes: spatiophysical,
   spatiobehavioral, spatiopsychosocial, and polity-based.
   Major Conclusions. Individually, existing instruments rely on selective
   classes of variables and therefore assess only parts of built
   environments that affect walking and bicycling. Most of the instruments
   and individual measures have not been rigorously tested because of a
   lack of available data on walking and bicycling and because of limited
   research budgets. Future instrument development will depend an the
   acquisition of empirical data on walking and bicycling, on inclusion of
   all three components of the behavioral model, and on consideration of
   all classes of variables identified.

AB Objective: The purpose of this epidemiologic study is twofold: first, to
   determine the relative frequency of sports-related injuries compared
   with all musculoskeletal injuries in patients 5 to 21 years of age
   presenting to the emergency department (ED), and second, to evaluate the
   sports-specific and anatomic site-specific nature of these injuries.
   Methods: Patterns of injury in patients 5 to 21 years of age presenting
   to four pediatric EDs with musculoskeletal injuries in October 1999 and
   April 2000 were prospectively studied. Information collected included
   age, sex, injury type, anatomical injury site, and cause of injury
   (sports-related or otherwise). Information about patient outcome and
   disposition was also obtained.
   Results: There were a total of 1421 injuries in 1275 patients.
   Musculoskeletal injuries were more common in male patients (790/62%)
   than in female patients. The mean age of the patients was 12.2 years
   (95% CI, 12.0-12.4). Sprains, contusions, and fractures were the most
   common injury types (34, 30, and 25%, respectively). Female patients
   experienced a greater percentage of sprains (44% vs 36%) and contusions
   (37% vs 33%) and fewer fractures (22% vs 31%) than male patients. Sports
   injuries accounted for 41% (521) of all musculoskeletal injuries and
   were responsible for 8% (495/6173) of all ED visits. Head, forearm, and
   wrist injuries were most commonly seen in biking, hand injuries in
   football and basketball, knee injuries in soccer, and ankle and foot
   injuries in basketball.
   Conclusions: Sports injuries in children and adolescents were by far the
   most common cause of musculoskeletal injuries treated in the ED,
   accounting for 41% of all musculoskeletal injuries. This represents the
   highest percentage of sports-related musculoskeletal injuries per ED
   visit reported in children to date. As children and adolescents
   participate in sports in record numbers nationwide, sports injury
   research and prevention will become increasingly more important.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether the availability and
   accessibility of physical activity resources differed by neighborhood
   socioeconomic status (SES) in a small U.S. city (population = 133,046).
   U.S. census tracts (N = 32) were used to represent neighborhoods and
   categorized into high, medium, or low SES on the basis of the percentage
   of unemployed individuals, per capita income, and percentage of the
   population below the poverty threshold. We developed a geographic
   information system to generate a comprehensive list of physical activity
   resources available within each census tract in the city., We identified
   112 parks, 33 sport facilities, 15 fitness clubs, 11 community centers,
   and 5 walking/biking trails. The total number of physical activity
   resources varied by neighborhood SES (p <.05); low-SES (M = 4.5 +/- 2.3)
   and medium-SES (M = 4.9 +/- 2.6) neighborhoods had significantly fewer
   resources than high-SES (M = 8.4 +/- 3.5) neighborhoods. Low-, medium-,
   and high-SES neighborhoods did not differ on the number of pay-for-use
   facilities; however, low-SES (M = 3.1 +/- 1.5) and medium-SES (M = 3.8
   +/- 1.6) neighborhoods had significantly fewer free-for-use resources
   than high- (M = 6.1 +/- 2.4) SES neighborhoods (p <.01). Data suggest
   that individuals from lower SES neighborhoods may have limited ability
   to control their physical activity in the face of inaccessible
   environments. Community research and promotion efforts should include
   assessment and targeting of available and accessible physical activity
   resources.

AB Nine months into the introduction of car sharing in San Francisco,

   vehicle miles traveled were by shared-use vehicles. Evidence suggests
   that access to shared cars is stimulating motorized travel. Most members
   do not own cars, and many appear to be leasing vehicles in lieu of
   walking and biking. Car-share vehicles are used more for personal
   business and social-recreational travel than for nondiscretionary,
   routine travel such as to work or school. Shared cars are generally not
   used during peak periods or to dense settings well served by transit,
   such as downtown. In this sense, car sharing appears to be stimulating a
   resourceful form of judicious automobility. Users are accruing
   substantial travel-time savings and willingly pay market prices for
   these benefits.

AB We have performed an ethnographic study that reveals the importance of
   social interaction, and especially traffic encounters, for the enjoyment
   of biking. We summarized these findings into a set of design
   requirements for a service supporting mobile interaction among
   motorcyclists. The Hocman prototype is designed to meet these
   requirements. It is an application for handheld devices equipped with
   wireless ad hoc networking interfaces. It uses a peer-to-peer
   architecture to accomplish sharing of HTML documents with peers in the
   immediate proximity. The aim of sharing is to spark social interaction
   among motorcyclists during brief encounters. We report a field trial on
   the prototype service in its naturalistic setting. Despite the
   unmanageable setting, e.g. the vast area, the speed, and unacquainted
   users, we demonstrate field trials as an effective approach to get
   feedback on how well a prototype service fulfils the design
   requirements. The results indicate that the conceptual idea of Hocman
   was appreciated, which suggest that the focus on interaction in traffic
   encounters fit with current practice of motorcycling.

AB Background Urban bicycle couriers may have a high incidence of injuries.
   Most messengers work as contractors and hence their injuries are not
   well documented.
   Methods To quantify injury rates and severity among urban bicycle
   couriers a convenience sample of 113 couriers in the city of Boston
   completed a two-page self-administered survey.
   Results Most working couriers have suffered at least one injury
   resulting either in days lost from work (70%) and in visits to a
   health-care professional or hospital (55%). The annual incidence rate
   for injuries resulting in days away from work was 47/100-bike couriers.
   Bone fractures accounted for the most days lost from work, followed by
   dislocations, sprains, and strains. Collisions and avoiding collisions
   with motor vehicles, including being "doored," and collisions with
   pedestrians accounted for the majority (66%) of events leading to
   injury. Twenty-four percent of messengers reported wearing a helmet on a
   regular basis, and 32% have health insurance.
   Conclusions Urban bicycle messengers are a poorly documented, largely
   unstudied workforce who suffer a very high rate of occupational injury.

AB The forest complex of Heverlee-Meerdaal, which consists of two forest
   parts, is located on a gradient from a rural region to an expanding
   urban area, Its vicinity to the city of Leuven and the adjacent
   conurbation leads to intense recreational use by the inhabitants. By
   means of counts an interpretation on congestion and on spreading of
   visitors in time and space in the area was made. On the basis of these
   counts questionnaires were carried out in the forest throughout the
   whole year and among all activity groups. In this context, little is
   known in depth about the interaction between the structural
   characteristics of the recreation site and recreation patterns in
   particular. The questionnaires deal with socio-demographical
   characteristics of the visitors, preferences and perceptions of the
   respective activity groups and their interpretation of the forest area
   concerning structure and infrastructure. According to this study, the
   geographical distribution of the visitors in the forest is highly
   determined by the position of the forest along a gradient relative to
   the conurbation. A total of 69% of the visitors lives within a radius of
   10 km and almost 38% originates from Leuven itself. Therefore, it can be
   considered to be an urban forest. The preferred activity is walking,
   followed successively by biking and jogging. Most of the people visit
   the forest on their own. Visit frequency and length are negatively
   correlated and strongly determined by the distance covered from the
   residence to the forest. Preferences and perceptions are influenced not
   only by social characteristics but also by the recreation activities and
   their specific interests and demands. The overall quality of the visit
   to the forest complex is evaluated very positive. (C) 2002 Elsevier

AB The Georgia Department of Transportation's Multi-modal Transportation
   Planning Tool (MTPT) facilitates multimodal planning in rural areas.
   Using open databases that are available agencywide, the tool can aid in
   the analysis of transportation requirements of rural areas, identify
   potential implementation constraints early in the planning process, and
   develop a prioritized project list by mode for an analysis region. The
   MTPT addresses highways, transit, intercity bus, commuter and passenger
   rail, aviation, and bicycles. An integrated geographic information
   system plays an important role in the presentation of the results. This
   paper discusses the development of the MTPT and describes program
   functionality. The paper will be of particular interest to state
   transportation agencies interested in using statewide databases for
   multimodal planning purposes. Described techniques identify how data
   that are typically collected and maintained for an entire state (e.g.,
   traffic volumes, posted speeds, designated bike routes, roadway
   functional classes, crash information, and county-based socioeconomic
   data) can be combined with field verified default factors, widely
   accepted planning and analysis methods, and additional regionally
   calibrated planning algorithms to perform system-level planning at the
   city, county, multicounty, or state levels.

AB Purpose: Noncommunicable diseases are emerging in developing countries.
   However, few studies have been conducted in those countries to evaluate
   the role of physical activity in the development of cardiovascular
   diseases. This study investigated physical activity and its relationship
   to risk factors for cardiovascular disease in a large population (N =
   799) of civil servants from Benin City, Nigeria. Methods: Physical
   activity levels were estimated by an interviewer-administered
   questionnaire, which determined the average hours per week over the past
   year spent in occupational and leisure activities. Time spent walking or
   biking to work was assessed is well. Other major measures included body
   mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), blood pressures, plasma insulin
   level, lipid profiles, and diet. Results: More of the physical activity
   was attributed to occupational than to leisure activities. Compared with
   women, men had a higher activity level. No significant trend was
   observed across age groups. Male senior staff (a marker of higher
   socioeconomic status) had a lower physical activity level than male
   junior staff. Physical activity, especially time walking or biking to
   work, was inversely correlated with weight, BMI, WHIZ, blood pressures,
   insulin, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides
   in men, while such correlations were not consistent in women. In
   multivariate analysis in men, blood pressure and insulin were
   independently associated with BMI but not with walking, while an
   independent inverse association was seen between walking and BMI.
   Conclusion: Lack of physical activity was associated with adverse risk
   profiles for cardiovascular disease in this developing population.

   study explores possible gender bias in measurement of physical activity
   in population studies.
   Methods: Data collected by telephone (CATI) from the Berne Lifestyle
   Panel in 1996 is utilised. A representative sample of the population of
   the city of Berne comprised N = 1119 cases. Gender differences are
   assessed for the weekly frequency of three measurements of physical
   activities.
   Results: An indicator of sport and exercise showed higher physical
   activity among men, while the indicator of habitual physical activity
   showed higher rates of daily walking and biking among women. A combined
   indicator of general physical activity showed no significant gender
   differences.
   Conclusions: The results provide empirical evidence on potential risk of
   underestimation of physical activity among women and of
   misclassification with respect to high or low risk behaviour patterns.

AB Sandia assessed white LED lamps for parking lot, security and bike path
   lighting for the City of Albuquerque. Powering these lamps with
   photovoltaics was of particular interest to the city. Eight commercially
   available lamps were tested; one was AC and all others were 12-volt DC.
   Because DC-only photovoltaic systems do not regulate output voltage, a
   12-volt nominal photovoltaic system can see a voltage range from
   10.5-15.3 volts. Therefore, the LED lamp must be specified for the DC
   voltage range expected with a photovoltaic system. We found several
   failed lamps at the high voltage range of our test, which is below
   voltages that can be seen in the field. In addition, LED lamps need to
   be more powerful and cost competitive, and temperature and lifetime
   issues need to be addressed in order to be more widely useful with
   photovoltaic systems for illumination applications. We concluded that
   presently available white LED lighting powered by photovoltaics could be
   considered for bike path lighting applications where the area is remote,
   or for security lighting in areas that are difficult to access. We do
   not recommend LED lamps for much larger flux levels such as parking lot
   fighting at this time.

   58 parents were interviewed. The traffic intesity in the vincinity of

   19% of the parents lived in inner city areas, 62% in suburbs and 19% in
   the countryside. Suburbian children had a safe traffic environment.
   Inner city- and countryside children predominately lived in
   high-intensity traffic environment. Inner city- and suburb children
   frequently used the bike, in inner city as a tool for play and in the
   suburbs mainly as a means of transport. Countryside children seldom used
   their bicycle.
   In inner city areas carefulness in traffic and in the other two
   independence was emphazised. Only 16% reported cooperation between home
   and school on traffic matters.
   Traffic accidents were concentrated to children living in suburbs
   (p<0.01). 81% of accidents were reported by parents having independence
   as a goal for traffic training (p<0.01).
   The reasults underline that traffic accident risk is strongly contingent
   on the local traffic environment and informal parenteral education in
   traffic safety.

AB The choice behaviour of low cost travel (LCT) modes is very sensitive to
   travel distance. A line haul system designed on the basis of current
   planning practice of locating widely spaced stations to cater auto and
   bus feeder modes with the primary objective of gaining travel speed is
   hostile to non-motorized and low cost feeder modes. With the revival of
   interest in promoting the use of walk'n ride and bike'n ride modes,
   there is a need to develop an appropriate tool to examine the effect of
   their specific characteristics in establishing the number and location
   of stations.
   A generic normative behavioural hybrid model for locating the cost
   minimizing number and location of stations is developed for an LCT-fed
   line haul system. The model considers the system with many to many two
   dimensional line haul demand density function in which the density
   varies in both x- and y-directions. The feeder mode choice behaviour is
   incorporated in the model by integrating probability-access/egress
   distance function with the objective function. Explicit functional
   relationships among the parameters of these feeder modes such as modal
   share as a function of access/egress distance with the parameters of
   line haul systems are developed. Dynamic programming is used to minimize
   the system cost. The generic model is shown to collapse into several
   simplified models capable of yielding approximate solutions for several
   well known special cases. It has been shown that location of stations is
   sensitive to the through load on board as well as users' cost that
   defines the choice behaviour at large. Numerical examples are presented
   to demonstrate the applicability of the model.

AB Increases in per capita vehicle usage and associated emissions have
   spawned an increased examination of the ways in which our communities
   and regions are developing. Associated with increased vehicle usage are
   decreased levels of walking and biking, two valid forms of physical
   activity. The Surgeon General's 1996 report, Physical Activity and
   Health, highlights the increasing level of physical inactivity as a
   growing cause of mortality. The costs and benefits of contrasting land
   development and transportation investment practices have been the
   subject of considerable debate in the literature. Findings have been
   refuted based on methodological grounds and inaccurate interpretation of
   data. Several of these studies, their methodological approaches, and
   their critiques are analyzed. While most agree that the built
   environment influences travel, considerable disagreement exists over the
   likely impacts of increased density, mix, and street connectivity on air
   quality, and on transportation system performance and household activity
   patterns.

AB OBJECTIVES: To study the current status of incidence of injury among
   children and young adults and the causes of common injuries, and to
   estimate its socio-economic loss and extent of harmfulness.
   METHODS: Pupils in 19 primary and middle schools aged 7 to 18 years,
   totaling 14,533, were recruited with stratified cluster sampling during
   1998 to 1999 in Guangzhou, Maoming, Jiangmen and Shantou. Judgement for
   injury was based on the following criteria: (1) diagnosed and treated in
   hospitals or school clinics, (2) a half-day off or more due to injury,
   and (3) emergency management by pupils' parents or teachers.
   RESULTS: There were 6 941 pupils suffered from varied injures during the
   year, with an incidence rate of 47.76% (50.08% for boys and 45.02% for
   girls). Incidence rate of injury was higher in the middle school pupils
   (13 - 18 years old, 58.49%) than that in the primary school pupils (7 -
   12 years old, 40.08%). The incidence increased significantly with age,
   with a peak at ages of 13 - 15. Major causes of injuries resulted from
   falls, injury by sharp articles, collision, traffic injuries and
   burn/scalds, etc, which usually occurred due to carelessness in sports,
   playing, walking, bike-riding and working. Frequency of multiple
   injuries related to the educational level of parents and depended on
   whether or not an only-child in family. There were 2,173 injured pupils
   (accounting for 31.3% of the total) visited clinics or emergency
   department in hospitals and 627 (9.0%) hospitalized for treatment.
   Twenty-eight percent of the injured pupils were absent from school, with
   an average absenteeism of 5.6 days. There were 154 injured pupils with
   transient disability and 53 with permanent disability, with a disability
   rate of 410.47 per 100,000. Cost for their medical care averaged 81.5
   yuan RMB per injured pupil.
   CONCLUSIONS: Injury was a common and frequently-happened incident among
   children and young adults and could seriously affect their health,
   development and growth, studying and their future of children and young
   adults. Health education, safety-promotion and removing hidden danger
   for injury are the major measures to prevent from injury, and the
   government and the whole society should pay great attention to injury
   issues in children and young adults.

   Santiago.-We consider the incorporation of a dense network of
   cycle-ways, fully segregated from motorised traffic, and the inclusion
   of adequate bicycle shelter facilities at Metro, suburban train and
   selected segregated bus-way stations. We designed and applied a
   methodology which included: (i) a review of national and international
   experience; (ii) focus group surveys; (iii) a household survey including
   stated preference experiments for potential bicycle users; (iv)
   estimation of various models with this data, and (v) model application
   using extra data available for the whole of the city. Our results
   indicate that there are sectors of the city where bikes could capture
   more than 10% of the trips, and that, on average, the use of bicycles
   could jump from its current 1.6% to approximately 5.8%. Finally, our
   results also show clearly that;trip length is a fundamental variable;
   therefore, land use policies geared to the development of urban
   sub-centres could have a significant impact in the future of this clean
   and efficient mode of transport. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

AB Background/Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of
   a community-based bike helmet promotion campaign on bike helmet use and
   related head injuries in children (0 to 14 years of age) in a large
   North American city.
   Methods The authors established a multifaceted, multidisciplined,
   community-based campaign to promote bike helmet use by children in 1989.
   The goals were to increase helmet use by 100% per year, to reduce fatal
   bike-related head injuries by 50% overall, and to explore the
   feasibility of legislation mandating helmet use. Helmet use was measured
   by standardized field observations repeated annually in a single borough
   within the metropolitan area. To estimate head injury incidence, the
   number of admissions to hospital for the treatment of bike-related head
   injuries in a regional trauma registry which included all residents in
   the target population was used. The authors were unable to control for
   changes in exposure to bicycling or in the criteria for admissions to
   hospital for the treatment of head injuries during the study period.
   Results: The bike helmet use rate rose from 4% in 1990 to 67% in 1996,
   The number of head injury admissions fell from 46 in 1990 to 24 in 1996,
   Legislation requiring helmet use by all children went into effect in
   October 1995.
   Conclusions: Bike helmet use increased significantly during the first 4
   years of the campaign and again after the helmet law was implemented.
   The total number of bike-related head injury admissions declined by more
   than 50%, The campaign achieved all of its goals except for a 50%
   reduction in fatal head injuries, which were too infrequent for
   analysis. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B. Saunders Company.

AB T&D editor-in-chief Pat Galagan interviewed dot.com CEO Kim Fisher,
   whose San Francisco-based startup, AudioBasket.com, employs mostly
   young, techno-savvy workers. Fisher's retention strategy: a solid
   business plan; a friendly, hardworking culture; and a nurturing
   leadership style.
   In the venture's first 10 months, the headcount has swelled from three
   to 40, and no one has jumped ship. Fisher calls her approach to building
   a talent pool "nerdworking." AudioBasket's founders tapped people they'd
   known in school, and those recruits widened the nerd net to friends and
   acquaintances in other high-tech companies. In fact, when AudioBasket
   employees bring in a prospect, they earn points in a lottery for a
   three-day getaway. If the prospect is hired, the person who did the
   recruiting gets 500 shares of stock.
   Galagan describes the environment in the warehouse office: Bikes propped
   everywhere, two computers to a desk, no dress code, unless it's
   headsets. "Our culture is down-to-earth," says Fisher.
   That doesn't mean that AudioBasket's employees don't work hard. There
   are long hours and short deadlines. And there's a lot of
   "matrixing"-employees must play multiple roles. For instance, every
   employee has been trained formally on how to make a pitch to venture
   capitalists-the VCs, as they're referred to. But despite all that (or
   perhaps because of it), the AudioBasket family is fired up about making
   the firm a success.
   "We've created jobs to build on," says Fisher. Says one employee, "New
   ideas are welcome and taken seriously."

   personal exposure monitors during a 24 week sampling period from fall
   1990 to spring 1991 in Helsinki, Finland. Arithmetic mean of the maximum
   1 and 8 h exposure levels were 6.0 and 3.3 mg m(-3). The then Finnish
   ambient air quality guideline values for 1/8 h maximum CO level (30/10
   mg m(-3)) were exceeded in 2/4% of the children's daily maximum 1/8 h
   exposure levels. Gas stove at home, parents, especially mother, smoking
   in the home, and living in high rise buildings - reflecting higher local
   population and traffic density - increased the children's CO exposures.
   The presence of a fireplace in the home was associated with decreased CO
   exposures. Father's high education reduced the children's CO exposure
   while mother's education level had no significant effect. The peak (15
   min) exposure levels of the children commuting to day care center by car
   or bus were higher than those of the children who walked or came by
   bike. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many European cities use colored markings at bicycle-motor vehicle
   crossings to reduce conflicts. To determine whether such colored
   markings help improve safety at American bicycle-motor vehicle
   crossings, the city of Portland, Oregon, studied the use of blue
   pavement markings and a novel signage system to delineate selected
   conflict areas. The University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research
   Center (HSRC), under contract to FHWA, analyzed the project data. From
   1997 to 1999, Portland marked 10 conflict areas with paint, blue
   thermoplastic, and an accompanying "Yield to Cyclist" sign. All of the
   sites had a high level of cyclist and motorist interaction, as well as a
   history of complaints. The crossings were all at locations where the
   cyclist travels straight and the motorist crosses the bicycle lane in
   order to exit a roadway (such as an off-ramp situation), enter a
   right-turn lane, or merge onto a street from a ramp. The study used
   videotape analysis and found most behavior changes to be positive.
   Significantly higher numbers of motorists yielded to cyclists and slowed
   or stopped before entering the blue pavement areas, and more cyclists
   followed the colored bike-lane path. However, the blue pavement also
   resulted in fewer cyclists turning their heads to scan for traffic or
   using hand signals, perhaps signifying an increased comfort level. The
   overwhelming majority of cyclists and close to a majority of motorists
   surveyed felt the blue areas enhanced safety. Colored pavement and
   signage should continue to be used and evaluated in bicycle-motor
   vehicle conflict areas.

AB The quality of transport networks does not only depend on the quality of
   the individual links and nodes, but also on the way these nodes and
   links function in the context of multimodal networks. In the present
   paper we focus on multimodal trips where the railways are the main
   transport mode. We discuss detour and frequency problems related to
   multimodal transport chains. Local accessibility of railway stations is
   an important determinant of railway use in the Netherlands. We find that
   the propensity to make use of rail services by people living in the ring
   between 500 to 1000 meters from a railway station is about 20% lower
   than of people living at most 500 meters away from railway stations. At
   distances between 1.0 and 3.5km the distance decay effect is about 30%,
   and above this distance it may reach values up to 50%. Non-motorized
   transport modes are dominant at both the home-end and the activity-end.
   A rather unique feature of the home-end access mode is the high share of
   the bicycle. More than one out of every three passengers uses the bike
   on the trip from home to station. At the activity-end the share of the
   bike is much smaller, because of the asymmetry in the supply of this
   transport mode in the home versus activity-end. This explains the
   dominant position of walking as the access mode at the activity-end.
   Implications are discussed for physical planning and the need for
   facilities near railway stations.

AB A quasi-experimental held study was carried out in 24 volunteers with
   the aim of: (i) assessing personal exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons
   polluting urban areas; and (ii) exploring the role of polymorphic
   enzymes relevant to the biotransformation of benzene in the
   inter-individual variability of biomarkers. Each subject covered by
   bicycle: (i) inner city routes with often jammed traffic; and (ii) open
   rural routes. Time-weighted average airborne concentrations of benzene,
   toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) were determined during 2-h
   runs. BTEX were determined by solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME)
   followed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in
   blood and spot urine samples collected just before and immediately after
   the runs. Urinary t,t-muconic acid was measured by high performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC)-UV. Genotypes of epoxide hydrolase (EH) and
   glutathione-S-transferase class mu-1 (GSTM1) were also characterised. As
   compared to pre-run values, benzene and toluene in blood, and toluene
   and xylenes in urine significantly increased after urban runs. Urinary
   t,t-muconic acid was significantly higher in post-run samples after both
   urban (P < 0.001) and rural runs (P < 0.05). Despite a narrow range of
   exposure levels, a significant relationship was observed between
   airborne benzene and post-run t,t-muconic acid (r(2) = 0.349, P <
   0.001). When subgroups were distinguished according to EH and GSTM1,
   subjects bearing both the EH wild type and GSTM 'null' genotype showed
   significant exposure-related changes in t,t-muconic acid excretion. Even
   at very low exposure levels, a 2-h bike run in a polluted urban
   environment may give rise to measurable changes in biomarkers of
   internal dose of selected aromatic hydrocarbons. Genetically-based
   metabolic differences may account for part of the inter-individual
   variability of biomarkers of exposure. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland

AB Over the past two decades, the number of bicycle trips in the United
   States has doubled. Since 48% of trips by all modes in American cities
   are shorter than three miles, the potential for further growth in
   bicycling seems enormous. So far, efforts to promote bicycling have
   focused on building bike paths and bike lanes. Although necessary,
   separate cycling facilities must be complemented by a comprehensive
   program to make all roads bikeable, through both physical adaptations
   and enforcement of cyclists' right to use the road. It seems likely that
   cycling will continue to grow in North America, but that its mode share
   will remain far lower than levels in northern Europe. Bicycling in
   Canada and especially the United States is impeded by the lack of a
   tradition of cycling for utilitarian purposes and by the marginal legal,
   cultural and infrastructure status of cyclists in both countries'
   automobile-based transport systems. As long as car use remains cheap and
   transportation policy remains dominated by motoring, bicycles will
   continue to be used primarily for recreation and not for daily urban
   travel in North America. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

AB Study objective: To describe injuries during a 1-day urban cycling tour.
   Methods: During the May 1996 "Bike New York" tour, we monitored EMS
   calls to identify injuries in a cohort of helmeted cyclists shielded
   from traffic. We collected demographic information from entry records,
   injury data from ambulance call reports, and follow-up on transported
   patients from telephone interviews with emergency physicians. Data were
   summarized using proportions, relative risks (RRs), 95% confidence
   intervals (Cls), and chi(2) test.
   Results: Approximately 28,000 cyclists participated, of which 23,502
   (84%) were officially registered. Sixty-eight percent of registered
   bicyclists were male, and 92% were between 18 and 55 years old. Of the
   140 EMS calls made during the tour, 136 (97%) involved participants;
   this yielded an injury incidence of 5 per 1,000 riders, or 12 to 13 per
   100,000 person-miles. Injury was more common among younger cyclists
   (RR=1.4 for age less than or equal to 35 years versus age >35 years; 95%
   CI, 1.0 to 2.0; P<.05), and possibly women (RR=1.3; 95% CI, .9 to 1.8,
   P=.11). Injuries were mostly minor, but there were 7 concussions and 6
   clavicle fractures; none of the 140 injuries was fatal. Thirty-eight
   calls resulted in ED transport, and 5 of these patients were admitted.
   Although EMS units were evenly distributed along the route, most EMS
   calls occurred in only 3 of the 7 zones (P<.001).
   Conclusion: Injuries during the largest 1-day US cycling tour were
   uncommon, More data are needed to determine the relative importance of
   injury risk factors. Data collection during mass events may help guide
   distribution of EMS personnel.

AB Clint Eastwood hurls a horseshoe into a sandy pit and it clangs solidly
   around the stake. That's not only a ringer, but also an example of tacit
   learning-what we know in our guts how to do, even if we can't explain
   how to do it to anyone else.
   Durrance talks extensively with Hirotaka Takeuchi, a professor at
   Harvard Business School and author of The Knowledge Creating Company:
   How Japanese Companies Create the Dynamics of Innovation. We all engage
   in tacit learning every day-riding a bike, driving a car, using a
   keyboard. We don't think about it; we just do it. Tacit knowledge is
   forming when we're least aware, and companies are trying to find ways to
   make employees' tacit knowledge explicit so that it can be shared.
   One example is a joint project of Xerox France and Xerox Pale Alto
   Research Center. Called Smart Services, the program foregoes manuals in
   favor of facilitating technicians' learning through their sharing of
   "war stories" about problem solving. At another firm that wanted to
   create meeting rooms for teams, the designers observed how team members
   actually communicated and worked together daily. Turns out that they
   shared a lot of learning in the hallways. Consequently, the designers
   redid the hallways to enhance the mobile, fluid kind of interaction that
   was taking place. Peter Senge says that the key to making tacit
   knowledge explicit is action. When the conversion is complete, people
   have an aha! experience. Many experts say that no matter what learning
   technology is used, the necessary elements are a master facilitator, a
   learning environment, action, refection, and trust.
   The article includes tips an how to cultivate the sharing of people's
   tacit knowledge, a discussion of groupware, and several additional
   resources.

AB Several travel indicators were compared between telecommuting (TC) days
   and non telecommuting days for a sample of 72 center-based telecommuters
   in California. Distance traveled decreased significantly on TC days,
   with average reductions of 51 person-miles (58%) and 35 vehicle-miles
   (53%). When weighted by telecommuting frequency, average reductions of
   11.9% in PMT and 11.5% in VMT were found over a five-day work week.
   Person-trips and vehicle-trips increased slightly (but not
   significantly) on TC days. This was due to statistically significant
   increases in commute trips by telecommuters (who more often went home
   for lunch on their TC days), partly counteracted by decreases in
   non-commute travel. The drive-alone mode share increased on TC days,
   both for all trips, and for commute trips in particular. Walking and
   biking shares also increased modestly on TC days, whereas shares of
   transit and ridesharing declined. Despite the increase in trip rates,
   TC-day reductions were found for all pollutants analyzed: 15% for total
   organic gas emissions, 21% for carbon monoxide, 35% for oxides of
   nitrogen, and 51% for particulate matter. The reduction in VMT more than
   compensated for the marginal increase in number of trips (and
   consequently, cold starts) on telecommuting days. (C) 1998 Elsevier

AB In January 1997 the Bellevue, Washington, office of CH2M HILL, a
   full-service engineering consulting firm, implemented a new
   transportation management plan (TMP), replacing an innovative TMP
   implemented in 1987 that had gained attention nationwide. The results
   were remarkable: drive-alone commuting by CH2M HILL employees dropped
   from 61 to 40 percent in just a few months' time. An employee-led
   committee adopted the new TMP before an increase in parking fees, a
   condition of the company's building lease. The committee desired to
   offer employees an alternative to higher parking fees. The new TMP
   included King County Metro's transportation benefits package called the
   FlexPass, along with a host of other incentives. The combination of
   higher parking fees and very inexpensive access to transit and vanpools
   led to a successful update to an already effective program. It is
   important to note that the tools were largely in place to support the
   mode shift: The CH2M HILL office is located within a city block of the
   downtown Bellevue transit center; an extensive park-and-ride system
   supports the transit center; the building is equipped with bike racks,
   showers, and lockers and is served by a transportation management
   organization; and the company has corporate vehicles available for
   work-related trips. Since these favorable conditions were already in
   place, the combination of the transit incentive and parking cost
   increase changed employees' commuting habits.

AB Trails shared by hikers, bicyclists, and joggers present the unusual
   traffic flow situation of a facility serving three classes of users with
   distinctly different flow characteristics. Data on typical trail volumes
   are summarized. A procedure developed by Botma to describe quality of
   flow on shared pedestrian/bicycle paths is then discussed. Data from two
   sites, the MKT Trail in Columbia, Missouri, and a riverside trail in
   Brisbane, Australia, were collected to describe speed and passing time
   characteristics on shared trails. The frequency of desired overtakings
   (passes) and potential conflicts on trails are estimated based on
   measured speeds and passing times using basic relationships of traffic
   flow theory. These estimates are then compared with measured values of
   overtaking frequency and delayed overtakings. The estimates for passing
   demand and potential conflicts were higher than the measured values for
   hikers passing hikers and joggers passing hikers. However, estimates for
   bike passing bike, bike passing jogger, bike passing hiker, and jogger
   passing jogger were found to be similar to the measured values. The
   results support the Botma framework for describing quality of flow on
   shared pedestrian/bicycle paths.

AB Multiple studies have shown a protective effect for physical activity on
   the incidence of colorectal cancer, but few have addressed its
   association with incident adenomas and none have investigated its
   association with metachronous adenomas, We interviewed 2,001 patients
   undergoing colonoscopy in 3 New York City practices between 1986-1988.
   Of these, 298 had a first diagnosis of adenomas, 506 had normal
   colonoscopies, 197 had metachronous adenomas and 345 had normal
   colonoscopies with a past history of adenomas. Subjects were queried
   regarding use of moderate amounts of recreational exercise (swimming,
   jogging, biking, racket sports and other sports) on a regular basis, and
   were also asked to estimate their revel of physical activity.
   Occupational physical activity was assessed through a blinded coding of
   occupational titles. After adjusting for age, years of education, body
   mass index, total caloric intake, dietary fiber intake, dietary fat
   intake and years of cigarette smoking, protective effects of borderline
   significance were observed among males for leisure physical activity for
   metachronous and incident cases. Occupational physical activity was
   found to be significantly protective in mate incident cases. Men with
   increased levels of either occupational or leisure activity showed a
   reduction for incident and metachronous cases. No effects were observed
   for females. Thus, in this study, both leisure and occupational physical
   activity were associated with a reduced risk of incident and
   metachronous adenomas among men but not women. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Measures in transportation planning aim at slowing-down the increase of
   traffic and at a reduction of private cars in a modal split. There
   obviously is considerable spatial influence as to modal split, but
   changes in modal split (1982-1994) are much more marked than changes in
   spatial structure. These changes are mainly caused by behavioural change
   (to be interpreted as the spreading of ''urban lifestyles'') and an
   increasing flexibility in activity timing, with an increase in the
   distances travelled, thus reducing the competitiveness of public
   transport. In order to achieve the planning objectives a bundle of
   measures have to be introduced simultanously. A decentral concentration
   of population in specified centres in the surroundings of the city of
   Salzburg is of paramount importance and has to be accomplished by
   improving public transport in these centres and by measures for
   multimodal travel (Bike&Ride, Park&Ride).

AB The Harlem Hospital Injury Prevention Program (HHIPP) was established in
   1988 with the goal of reducing injuries to children in central harlem by
   providing safe play areas, supervised activities, and injury prevention
   education. To achieve this goal, a broad-based coalition was formed with
   state and local governmental agencies interested in injury prevention
   and with community groups, schools, parents, and hospital staff. An
   evaluation of the program in terms of both process and outcome formed a
   critical element of this effort.
   Since 1988 the HHIPP, as the lead agency for the Healthy
   Neighborhoods/Safe Kids Coalition, developed or participated in two
   types of programs: injury-prevention education programs and programs
   that provide safe activities and/or environments for children. The
   educational programs included Window Guards campaign; Safety City
   Program; Kids, Injuries and Street Smarts Program (KISS); Burn
   Prevention Curriculum and Smoke Detector Distribution; Harlem
   Alternative to Violence Program; Adolescent Outreach Program; and
   Critical Incident Stress Management Teams. The safe activities and
   environmental programs included the Bicycle Safety Program/Urban Youth
   Bike Corps; Playground Injury Prevention Program; the Greening of Harlem
   Program; the Harlem Horizon Art Studio; Harlem Hospital Dance Clinic;
   Unity through Murals project; baseball at the Harlem Little League;
   winter baseball clinic; and the soccer league.
   Each program was conceived using injury data, coupled with parental
   concern and activism, which acted as catalysts to create a community
   coalition to respond to a specific problem. Data systems developed over
   time, which monitored the prevalence and incidence of childhood injuries
   in northern Manhattan, including central harlem, became essential not
   only to identify specific types of childhood injuries in this community
   but also to evaluate these programs for the prevention of injuries in
   children.
